  <title>Customer Experience in Retail: What Are the Challenges?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/client-experience-in-retail</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_Customer experience is a decisive factor for success in the increasingly competitive retail sector. What are the main challenges you need to overcome to succeed? I’ll share them in this post!_** 

Customers are the main product of any business—everything depends on them. And their search goes beyond just products; they want connection, relationships, conversations. **They seek a smooth, personalized, and satisfying shopping experience at every point of contact with your brand.** 

Because of this, failing to meet these expectations can result in a significant loss of customers, as bad experiences are quickly shared, especially on social media.

When I refer to bad experiences, I don’t mean something necessarily terrible or catastrophic; sometimes a simple procedure, intended to ensure their own safety, can cause friction.

This is why WhatsApp has become so important, offering a channel that smooths out all your communication.

Today, I’m going to talk about the five key challenges affecting customer experience in retail, with real examples from brands that have successfully faced them, along with suggested solutions to overcome these obstacles.

In this post, you'll find:

*   The direct impact of customer experience on profitability and customer loyalty
*   Challenge 1: Creating smooth experiences between physical and digital channels
*   Challenge 2: Using first-party data to offer personalized experiences
*   Challenge 3: Ensuring data privacy and compliance without compromising the experience
*   Challenge 4: Adapting to new consumer expectations for effective loyalty
*   Challenge 5: Accurately measuring return on investment in customer experience
*   Closing the gap: Customer experience as a growth engine in retaill

The Direct Impact of Customer Experience on Profitability and Loyalty
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You can’t underestimate the relevance of customer experience in retail, especially in a hyper-competitive environment where products and services have become easily interchangeable.

Differentiation lies in the ability to offer exceptional experiences at every interaction that anticipate and exceed consumer expectations. They demand smoothness and precise personalization, supported by real-time data and robust technological solutions.

A poor handling of any of these points can cause irreparable losses, eroding the brand’s reputation within minutes.

Facing the challenges I’ll mention below is essential because only companies that master these aspects will have the ability to generate long-term loyalty and gain a sustainable competitive advantage.

Here are the five challenges you must overcome to optimize your customers' experience.

Challenge 1: Creating Smooth Experiences Between Physical and Digital Channels
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The integration of physical and digital channels](https://blog.truora.com/es/4-consideraciones-para-integrar-whatsapp-a-hubspot) is one of the biggest challenges in modern retail due to the intense traffic of consumers in both spaces. 

They expect to be able to research a product online, try it in a physical store, and eventually purchase it from their mobile devices or vice versa. This "omnichannel experience" is key to improving their satisfaction.

**Real example**:

*   [**Starbucks**](https://unifranz.edu.bo/blog/estrategias-omnicanal-ayudan-al-logro-de-experiencias-del-cliente-coherentes-y-fluidas/) has implemented an omnichannel system where customers can place orders through their mobile app and pick them up in any store.

Additionally, they can personalize their drinks and accumulate loyalty points regardless of the channel they use, creating a seamless experience.

**Suggested Solution**:

*   Implement a platform that synchronizes online and in-store inventories in real time.
*   Offer options such as:
    *   **Click & Collect** (buy online, pick up in-store)
    *   Returns through any channel

*   *   Unified [customer service](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente) across all channels, so customers can follow up, ask questions, or manage returns no matter where they purchased the product.

Challenge 2: Using First-Party Data to Offer Personalized Experiences
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Effectively using first-party data (data customers directly provide through their interactions with the brand) is essential to personalizing and optimizing your [sales process](https://blog.truora.com/es/c%C3%B3mo-impulsar-tus-procesos-de-ventas-a-trav%C3%A9s-de-whatsapp). 

However, many companies still don’t know how to make the most of this data to personalize experiences, which can lead to a disconnect between customer expectations and what is offered.

**Real Example**:

*   [**Nike**](https://fastercapital.com/es/tema/%C2%BFc%C3%B3mo-ha-utilizado-nike-la-tecnolog%C3%ADa-y-las-plataformas-digitales-para-conectarse-con-emprendedores-y-nuevas-empresas.html) uses its NikePlus app to collect data on customers' preferences, purchase history, and physical activities. 

With this information, they offer personalized recommendations for products and services like workouts and special discounts based on each customer’s individual preferences.

**Suggested Solution**:

*   Invest in advanced CRM systems that allow you to collect and analyze customer data in real time.
*   Offer recommendations based on previous customer behavior:
    *   Personalized product recommendations.
    *   Exclusive promotions based on purchase history.
    *   Customized discounts sent through channels like apps, email, or social media.

Challenge 3: Ensuring Data Privacy and Compliance Without Compromising the Experience
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the [growing amount of data businesses collect](https://blog.truora.com/es/integridad-de-bases-de-datos-para-prevenir-el-fraude) to personalize the customer experience, the challenge arises of ensuring privacy and complying with global regulations such as the GDPR in Europe and the CCPA in California, USA.

Customers are becoming more aware of how their data is used, and a breach of privacy can irreversibly damage trust in the brand.

**Real example**:

*   [**Apple**](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-62604541) has taken a strong stance on data privacy. With the implementation of new privacy policies in iOS, they give users more control over the data that apps can collect, promoting transparency and ensuring privacy. 

**Suggested Solution**:

*   Adopt clear and transparent policies regarding the use of customer data.
*   Implement advanced encryption technologies to protect personal and financial data.
*   Allow customers to control which data they share and how it is used.
*   Strictly comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA and keep customers informed of the security measures in place to protect their information.

Challenge 4: Adapting to New Consumer Expectations for Effective Loyalty
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With increasing competition and constantly changing expectations, [retaining customers](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-fidelizar-clientes) has become more difficult than ever. 

They have multiple options and are often attracted by immediate discounts or temporary promotions from other brands. Maintaining their loyalty requires more than just simple loyalty programs.

**Real Example**:

*   [**Sephora**](https://www.rewardix.com/sephora-y-su-increible-programa-de-fidelizacion-beauty-insider/) created a loyalty program called Beauty Insider that offers not only points for purchases but also exclusive experiences like makeup classes, early access to products, and exclusive events. 

This has allowed Sephora to maintain a loyal customer base despite intense competition in the beauty industry. 

**Suggested Solution**:

*   Implement loyalty programs that offer more than just points or discounts. Examples include:
    *   Early access to products
    *   Personalized services (such as exclusive events or consultations)
    *   Experiences that foster an emotional connection with the brand, not just price-based. 
*   Use social media and personalization to keep customers engaged with the brand.

Challenge 5: Accurately Measuring Return on Investment in Customer Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A major challenge for retailers is measuring the return on investment (ROI) in customer experience improvements.

Investing in technology, personalization, and staff training can be costly, and many businesses struggle to demonstrate the financial impact of these investments.

**Real Example**:

*   [**Disney**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/01/23/5-lessons-from-disneys-magical-customer-experience/) is an outstanding example of how a company can measure the ROI of customer experience. 

Through its MyMagic+ system, Disney has enhanced the experience of visitors at its theme parks, allowing customers to manage reservations, tickets, and purchases via a smart bracelet.

Despite the high initial investment, the increase in customer satisfaction and in-park purchases has shown a positive ROI over time.

**Suggested Solution**:

*   Define clear metrics to measure ROI, such as:
    *   Increased customer retention rate
    *   Increased purchase frequency
    *   Improved customer satisfaction (through surveys or feedback analysis)
    *   Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) 
*   Use data analytics tools that directly link investments in customer experience to financial results.

Closing the Gap: Customer Experience as a Growth Engine in Retail
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Customer experience in retail is undoubtedly one of the most decisive factors for long-term success in any business.

By facing and overcoming the challenges I mentioned in this post, you can create amazing experiences that place you at the top of your customers' preferences, turning them into advocates for your brand.

  <title>WhatsApp Business API being blocked by Meta: How to avoid it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/blocked-whatsapp-business-api</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_WhatsApp, the tool that handles, qualifies leads, sells and, at the same time, enhances the customer experience. That's why you can never afford to have your WhatsApp Business API blocked. In this article, I'll explain how you can protect yourself against that risk!_**

WhatsApp Business is a strategic ally for companies looking to consolidate their online presence because it serves as a direct and effective channel for communication with customers and leads.

However, amid these benefits looms a threatening shadow: the risk of blocking or suspension by Meta, [WhatsApp's](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) parent company.

Meta has established rigorous policies to ensure responsible use of the platform, and any violation of these rules can result in severe consequences, ranging from temporary suspensions to permanent account blocks.

This risk poses a tangible threat to operational continuity and the reputation of companies using WhatsApp Business for their conversational strategies because it can abruptly interrupt these vital operations, generating distrust among customers and negatively affecting the companies' image.

Therefore, in this article, I will give you 10 tips to avoid the risk of having your WhatsApp Business API blocked!

In this article, you will see:

*   The differences between WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Business API
*   10 tips to avoid having your WhatsApp Business API blocked
*   Truora, the best way to avoid unpleasant surprises

The differences between WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Business API
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before diving into the topic, let's establish the differences between these two approaches aimed at improving communication between companies and their customers because their scope, functions, and applications vary considerably.

### **WhatsApp Business: the ally of small and medium-sized enterprises**

WhatsApp Business, designed with small and medium-sized enterprises in mind, is presented as an optimized version of the messaging application we all know. 

Its goal is to provide local and emerging businesses with a platform to interact directly with their customers more effectively.

With features such as business profiles, automated responses and the ability to display detailed information, it is an excellent option for those looking to consolidate their online presence without the need for complex integrations.

**Key features of WhatsApp Business:**

*   **Business profiles:** allows you to create detailed profiles with key information, such as business hours, location and a description of your business.
*   **Automated responses:** you can provide quick and personalized responses to frequently asked questions, improving efficiency in customer service.
*   **Message tags:** allows you to tag messages to facilitate organization and tracking of conversations, providing you with more effective communication management.

### WhatsApp Business API: for large-scale companies and advanced solutions

On the other hand, WhatsApp Business API is positioned at the higher level, targeting companies with a significant volume of messages and requiring more advanced integrations.

This Application Programming Interface (API) allows you to interact with WhatsApp users through their existing infrastructure, taking your communication to a more sophisticated level.

**Advanced features of WhatsApp Business API:**

*   **Advanced integrations:** with CRM systems, facilitating comprehensive communication management and the collection of valuable data.
*   **Personalized automated messages:** more complex and hyper-personalized to offer more sophisticated user experiences.
*   **Conversational strategy management:** allows you to manage more complex conversation flows, guiding your users through structured and specific interactions.

In summary, the choice between WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Business API is not simply a matter of size but of the particular needs of your company.

Now let's look at the 10 tips I have prepared so you never run the risk of having your WhatsApp Business API account blocked.

10 tips to avoid having your WhatsApp Business API blocked
----------------------------------------------------------

To begin with, it is essential to highlight that the main objective of these conditions is to create a quality experience, taking into account detailed, updated information and authorization to send messages.

### **1 - Comply with the terms**

First and foremost, non-compliance with [the terms and conditions established by WhatsApp Business and Meta](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy?lang=es_LA) is one of the most serious causes that can lead to the blocking of an account.

These terms act as the fundamental rules that each user must follow to ensure proper use of the platform and offer users a quality experience.

Substantial violations, whether in conduct, content or any other aspect, can result in penalties ranging from temporary suspensions to permanent blocks.

### **2 - Be transparent**

You must be clear and honest in your communication with customers, avoiding deceptive or fraudulent practices. It is your responsibility to ensure that the content shared complies with regulations and does not infringe on users' rights.

If your company does not provide accurate and complete information about its identity, it may be viewed as suspicious and face disciplinary measures, including blocking.

### **3 - Do not use unofficial versions**

These versions may lack the necessary security measures and updates, leaving the account vulnerable to security issues and violations of the platform's policies.

The recommendation is always to use the official version to ensure compliance and security.

### **4 - Do not spam**

This anti-spam measure is implemented to preserve the quality of the user experience and prevent the saturation of unwanted messages.

You should avoid indiscriminate sending of messages and ensure that your communication has an appropriate frequency, is relevant and requested by the user.

### **5 - Use automated messages responsibly and technically**

While WhatsApp Business allows automated responses to improve efficiency, Meta imposes restrictions to prevent abuse of this resource.

Excessive use of automated responses can be considered invasive, so you must be prudent in their implementation and ensure that these responses add value to the user experience.

Here my advice is almost obvious, **hire the service of an agency specialized in making automation a competitive advantage.**

### **6 - Respect your users' privacy**

Respecting users' privacy is fundamental. Any action that violates their privacy, such as unauthorized access to personal information or improper disclosure of data, can lead to disciplinary measures, including account blocking.

### **7 - Never send inappropriate content**

The platform establishes strict restrictions on inappropriate content. Your company should refrain from sharing offensive, discriminatory or illegal material.

“"We prohibit the use of WhatsApp Business Services to purchase, sell, promote or otherwise facilitate the exchange of certain regulated or restricted goods and services, as determined by us at our sole discretion, including the following:

*   _Firearms_

*   _Tabaco and alcoholic beverages_

*   _Endangered species (flora and fauna)_

*   _Live animals not in danger of extinction (excluding livestock)_

*   _Hazardous products and materials_

*   Real, virtual or fake currency, including initial offers of cryptocurrencies and binary options

*   Real money gambling

*   Adult products and services

*   Dating services

*   Multi-level marketing

*   Microloans subject to verification of recurrent income (payday loans), salary advances, P2P loans, debt collection, and bail bonds

These prohibitions apply regardless of any local or international licenses, registrations or other approvals that your company may have” _(_[Source WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy?lang=es_LA)_)_.

### **8 - Never distribute deceptive content or engage in phishing.**

The creation and distribution of deceptive content or phishing is a serious cause for blocking on WhatsApp Business.

Attempting to fraudulently obtain confidential information from users not only goes against Meta's policies but also threatens the trust and security of the business community on the platform.

### **9 - Respect Copyrights**

Respecting copyright is a fundamental requirement. Sharing protected content without proper authorization can result in legal action and penalties from Meta. Your company must ensure it has the necessary rights to share any protected content and avoid legal violations.

### **10 - Regular Reviews and Updates**

It is crucial to stay vigilant about regular reviews and updates to Meta's policies.

The dynamics of the digital environment can change rapidly, and staying updated ensures that communication strategies are always in compliance with the latest regulations.

In summary, understanding and adhering to Meta's policies are essential for the success and security of businesses on WhatsApp Business. Navigating successfully within these parameters is not only a necessity but also a smart strategy to build and maintain a solid reputation in the digital business world.

  <title>Fraud Prevention: Balancing Security and Friction - How to Do It</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/prevencion-de-fraudes-0</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_In e-commerce, the fine line between security and user experience can be the same one between success and stagnation. Facing this dilemma is a matter of protecting data, but how do you prevent fraud while also guaranteeing a user experience that drives conversion?_**

Have you ever wondered how some companies manage to strike the perfect balance between a [robust authentication process](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc) and a seamless shopping experience?

The truth is, while security barriers protect against fraud, they can also become obstacles to a satisfying experience. This constant conflict is the challenge industry leaders face today.

Innovation is the solution. There are advanced methods that transform how we approach this dilemma, allowing strong security and optimized user experiences to coexist harmoniously. 

Instead of choosing one or the other, why not offer both? This article explores how new solutions can transform the e-commerce landscape, offering tools that combine security and usability. 

That’s what I’ll be talking about today; get ready to discover how to prevent fraud, protect your company and customers, all while ensuring a smooth and pleasant shopping experience.

In this post, you’ll see:

*   Frictionless authentication: a current approach to fraud prevention
*   Comparison with high-friction methods
*   Frictionless authentication
*   Tools to balance security and user experience
*   Practical tips for finding the ideal balance
*   Protection and usability, a necessary balance
*   Frictionless authentication: a current approach to fraud prevention

Frictionless authentication: a current approach to fraud prevention 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to minimize barriers for your users while maintaining high security standards. This is possible thanks to advanced technologies that prevent subjecting your customers to multiple verification layers.

Key benefits include:

1.  **Increased conversion rates:** By eliminating barriers, you facilitate a smoother shopping experience that doesn’t interrupt the purchase decision, increasing the chances that users will complete their transactions.
2.  **Reduced cart abandonment:** One of the main reasons users abandon their purchases is the complexity and time required to authenticate their identity. By simplifying this process, you reduce abandonment and minimize user frustration.
3.  **Improved customer loyalty and retention:** A seamless and risk-free experience builds trust in your platform, fostering long-term loyalty. Users are more likely to return and become regular customers when they feel safe and familiar with the processes.
4.  **Operational efficiency optimization:** With fewer manual or repetitive authentication processes, your team can focus on more strategic tasks, such as seizing more sales opportunities. 

Additionally, you can improve operational efficiency and reduce customer support costs.

1.  **Increased brand ambassadors:** Speed and ease translate into more recommendations and positive reviews, essentially turning customers into advocates who market your business for you.
2.  **Brand reputation protection:** Your company is positioned as a trustworthy and technologically advanced brand, strengthening its authority in the market.
3.  **Greater compatibility with mobile devices:** Ensure the process is quick and simple, optimizing the mobile experience and reducing abandonment on this platform.

These seven benefits are essential to increasing sales and reducing wasted time and resources. 

Comparison with high-friction methods
-------------------------------------

Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords, two-factor authentication (2FA), and security questions, are effective for [preventing fraud](https://blog.truora.com/es/casos-emblematicos-de-fraudes-financieros) but can be tedious for users, especially when overused.

### Passwords

Despite being ubiquitous, they have many drawbacks. Users often have to remember complex and different combinations for each platform, which can lead to forgetfulness, account lockouts, and frustration. 

Additionally, password recovery processes are another friction point that can disrupt the user experience and lead to purchase abandonment.

### Security questions

These add an extra layer of verification but can cause frustration when users don’t remember the exact answers, interrupting the shopping process. 

### Two-factor authentication (2FA) 

While secure, it can be seen as a hassle by users who must wait for a verification code or complete additional steps to finish a transaction.

Frictionless authentication
---------------------------

Now let’s talk about what Truora can help you with: **how to automatically verify users’ identities without requiring additional actions**. Some of the main methods include:

*   **Behavioral analysis:** This monitors and analyzes the user’s habitual behavior, such as browsing patterns and activity time, to detect any unusual activity without interrupting the user experience.
*   **Biometrics:** This uses the user’s unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to quickly and securely authenticate their identity, eliminating the need for passwords or additional codes.
*   **Facial recognition:** This verifies the user’s identity through facial recognition technology, enabling fast and effortless authentication, ideal for mobile devices.

These methods provide the perfect balance between security and convenience, offering a next-level experience.

Tools to balance security and user experience
---------------------------------------------

Now let’s look at the various tools developed to protect your company from fraud while maintaining a smooth and hassle-free authentication process.

### Data enrichment

This technique uses available information from multiple sources to enhance the accuracy of authentication decisions.

With Truora, you can combine data from different platforms to get a more complete view of a user’s identity and detect possible signs of fraud more effectively.

**For example,** your company can use social media data, past transaction histories, online behavior patterns, and access to [the largest database of fraudulent faces in Latin America](https://blog.truora.com/es/truface) to create a more detailed user profile and identify suspicious activity without adding extra steps to the authentication process.

### Risk scoring 

This is another key tool in [the fight against fraud](https://blog.truora.com/es/el-fraude-en-instituciones-financieras-latinoamericanas). This method assigns a score to each transaction or interaction based on the potential risk of it being fraudulent.

Factors such as geographic location, the device used, and transaction history help measure the risk. With Truora, you can tailor the level of verification according to the perceived risk. 

**For example,** a low-risk transaction can be completed with minimal authentication, while a high-risk transaction will require additional measures to verify the user’s identity.

Practical tips for finding the ideal balance
--------------------------------------------

It may seem complex, but there are several strategies and best practices that can help you achieve this goal.

### Adopt a risk-based approach

Use tools like the aforementioned risk scoring to adjust the level of authentication according to the situation. Not all transactions require the same level of security, and by tailoring authentication measures to the risk, you can reduce unnecessary friction.

### Customize the experience based on the user profile

The same goes for behaviors and needs. Implement solutions that allow you to personalize the authentication experience based on the user profile. 

### Optimize the mobile authentication process

Implement technologies that leverage mobile capabilities, like facial recognition, to offer a fast and frictionless authentication process anywhere.

### Prioritize customer experience in design

When designing your authentication systems, always prioritize the customer experience. Consider A/B testing to measure how different authentication methods impact user satisfaction and conversion rates.

### Incorporate emerging technologies

Frictionless authentication solutions like biometrics and behavioral analysis are constantly evolving. Stay up to date with the latest innovations and assess their implementation.

### Constantly monitor and adjust

Security in e-commerce is a constantly changing field. It’s crucial to regularly monitor your authentication processes and adjust them based on emerging threats and changes in user behavio.

### Educate your users

While friction can be minimized, it’s important that users understand why certain security measures are in place. Education and clear communication can help mitigate any frustration they may feel during the authentication process.

Protection and usability, a necessary balance
---------------------------------------------

While it’s tempting to increase security to the maximum, this should not be done at the expense of burdening users with complicated and tedious processes.

Ultimately, the success of any digital venture depends on the ability to offer security without sacrificing user convenience. This balance will protect you from fraud and provide a safer and more enjoyable environment for everyone.

  <title>Insurance Market: Challenges and Opportunities in 2024</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/insurance-market</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_ho provides security for insurers? The insurance industry in Latin America presents us with a contradictory and difficult-to-read scenario; on one hand, extremely promising, and on the other, full of risks. What is the answer? We'll tell you in this article!_**

Powerful tools are transforming the insurance business model. However, a humble instant messaging app is the one revolutionizing the insurance market, accelerating its speed and movement.

[Yes, I'm talking about WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp)! Not coincidentally, the word market comes from Mercury, the messenger god of the Greeks who had wings on his feet; buying and selling can be summed up as an exchange of messages.

That's why WhatsApp has become a fundamental tool to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. This is what we'll discuss today. In this article, you'll see: 

*   The resilience of the insurance market in Mexico and Latin America
*   Opportunities - the 3 technologies
*   The impact of Insurtech on the sector's transformation
*   Global and regional challenges
*   Who provides security to insurers

The Resilience of the Insurance Market in Mexico and Latin America
------------------------------------------------------------------

_“By the end of 2020, of the 128 million inhabitants in Mexico according to INEGI, 93 million had some type of insurance (including all direct policyholders or insured persons and their family members), representing 72% of the population.” -_ [Penetration of Insurance in Mexico, Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit of Mexico](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/671904/PENETRACION_DEL_SEGURO_EN_MEXICO_CON_SEGURIDAD_SOCIAL.pdf)**_._** 

In recent years, the insurance market has faced unprecedented challenges, yet it has grown considerably.

*   **The COVID-19 pandemic** destabilized economies and altered consumption patterns;
*   **Inflation and the devaluation** of local currencies put pressure on individual and corporate finances; 
*   **Wars** (such as Russia and Ukraine) and other global events have generated economic and social uncertainty.

These factors forced insurers to adapt quickly, reformulating their strategies to stay afloat, thrive in a constantly changing environment, and demonstrate remarkable resilience in the face of adversity. 

### Mexico 

The insurance market is growing at a steady pace, driven by the increasing demand for health and cyber insurance. The pandemic highlighted the importance of these products, and Mexican insurers have responded effectively to this emerging demand.

According to [AMIS](https://www.amisprensa.org/public/documentos/cifras-de-la-industria-segundo-trimestre-2022-21.pdf) **(Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions)** the insurance industry is solid and solvent with surprising data:

*   The sector **triples the amount of capital** required by law;
*   By the second quarter of 2022, **industry premiums reached 350.561 billion MXN**;
*   The industry **paid 200 billion MXN** to its insured; 
*   Life insurance is the operation with the highest amount.

### Colombia

In 2021, against a backdrop of global premium growth of 3.4% and 3.7% in Latin America, [Colombia reported a premium growth of 10.2%](https://www.prois.com.co/blog/post/retos-y-oportunidades-significativas-en-el-sector-asegurador), positioning itself as the third-largest market in Latin America. 

### Brazil

Brazilian insurers have invested significantly in digitalization and customer experience improvement, resulting in greater market penetration.

### Argentina

Inflation and the devaluation of the Argentine peso have led insurers to adjust their strategies and offer products more adapted to local needs.

Opportunities - The 3 Technologies
----------------------------------

Great opportunities come with the adoption of new technologies, and there are three that are revolutionizing how we operate and offer our services: 

*   WhatsApp; 
*   Blockchain;
*   Artificial Intelligence (AI).

**Does it make sense to compare a messaging app with two overwhelming concepts like AI and Blockchain?**

That is precisely the superpower of WhatsApp: super-fast, super-simple, and super-efficient at integrating into your customers' routines, while the other two are still concepts in the process of being understood. 

### WhatsApp: The Customer Magnet

Potential customers are always connected, and directing them to your insurance company depends on being on the right channels and meeting three key expectations:

*   **Simplicity:** Agile and frictionless processes that quickly respond to customer needs.
*   **Personalization:** Establishing close and personalized relationships with customers, offering precise recommendations and tailored messages.
*   **Omnichannel Experience:** Being present on customers' favorite channels, especially digital ones, providing an integrated and exceptional experience.

**[WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api) guarantees:**

*   Instant and effective communication with quick and direct responses.
*   [Effortless integration](https://blog.truora.com/es/4-consideraciones-para-integrar-whatsapp-a-hubspot) to ensure an omnichannel experience.
*   Intelligent automation and segmentation to personalize your communication.

All this securely, with all the layers of protection your company deems necessary.

### Blockchain: Transforming Trust and Transparency

This technology uses a decentralized network and an immutable ledger system to store data securely and transparently, with the potential to transform how we manage contracts and claims. 

*   By using blockchain-based smart contracts, we can automate processes, eliminate intermediaries, and reduce administrative costs. Moreover, the immutability of blockchain records ensures data integrity and reduces the risk of fraud.

### Artificial Intelligence: Enhancing Personalization and Efficiency

With advanced algorithms and sophisticated data analysis, AI allows us to analyze large volumes of information to identify patterns, predict behaviors, and make more informed decisions.

In the insurance sector, AI is used for a wide range of applications, from risk assessment and pricing to customer service and claims management. 

*   [AI-powered chatbots](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-transferir-tus-conversaciones-de-un-chatbot-de-whatsapp-a-un-humano-con-hubspot) can provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, improving user experience and reducing the burden on human staff. 
*   Additionally, AI algorithms can analyze claim data to identify trends and potential fraud, enabling proactive measures to mitigate risks and enhance operational efficiency.

The Impact of Insurtech on Sector Transformation
------------------------------------------------

Insurtech, startups using innovative technology to transform the insurance industry, play a crucial role in accelerating the sector's digital transformation by offering more agile, efficient, and personalized solutions.

*   By using digital platforms and data-driven business models, these companies reach market segments traditionally underserved by traditional insurers. 

They also simplify the insurance purchasing process, making it faster and more convenient for customers. 

#### Claims

Another area where Insurtech is innovating is claims management. 

*   By leveraging technologies like AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), these companies can automate much of the claims process, reducing response times and improving customer experience. 

Global and Regional Challenges
------------------------------

The interconnection of financial markets and economic volatility directly impact the demand and supply of insurance, as well as insurers' ability to operate and grow sustainably.

### Preventing Fraud

The insurance industry faces a trust crisis, evidenced by alarming figures: fraud costs the sector $42 billion annually.

This risk is particularly high during customer acquisition and onboarding processes, where insurance companies are more vulnerable.

**To combat fraud, companies must:**

*   **Detect and deter:** Implement systems to identify potential fraud before it occurs.
*   **Intercept:** Have mechanisms to stop ongoing fraudulent activities.
*   **Comply with regulations:** KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).

The key is to automate trust by creating seamless and reliable processes integrated with technological solutions that [ensure user identity](https://blog.truora.com/es/beneficios-de-verificar-la-identidad-de-tus-usuarios-por-whatsapp) using the same channel (WhatsApp).

### Offering Financial Protection

The need for financial protection becomes even more evident. People and companies seek to safeguard their assets and wealth against risks like job loss, currency devaluation, and catastrophic events that can result in significant financial losses.

### Diversifying Products and Services

To seize these emerging opportunities, insurers are diversifying their product and service offerings to meet the changing needs of the market.

### Adapting to Reforms and Legislative Changes

These reforms can affect the operating and regulatory environment of the insurance industry, presenting both challenges and opportunities for insurance companies that can adjust and respond effectively to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape.

Who Provides Security to Insurers?
----------------------------------

**The answer is Truora**, with its cutting-edge technology, it ensures that your insurance company can use WhatsApp to capture leads, performing all necessary security processes without leaving the app.

  <title>KYC in Colombia: What Do You Need to Comply?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/kyc-colombia</url>
  <content>**_Compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) in Colombia is a cornerstone for the proper and ethical functioning of financial institutions. It is the link that establishes a relationship of trust between financial entities and their customers. In this post, I'll cover everything about this topic!_**

[KYC](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc) in Colombia is a crucial mechanism for maintaining transparency and preventing illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing within the financial system. 

As the name suggests, Know Your Customer focuses on the fundamental principle of understanding the users of financial services and comprehensively knowing:

*   Who they are.
*   What their financial activities are.
*   What their needs are.

This not only involves verifying their identity and financial history but also continuously monitoring their transactions to detect any suspicious activity.

KYC protects financial institutions from being used for criminal activities, safeguards the integrity of the entire financial system, and protects the customers themselves. 

For these three reasons, KYC has become a fundamental element in the digital business landscape. Today, I'll talk about the KYC process in Colombia and the necessary steps to complete it. In this article, you will see: 

*   What is KYC?
*   Why is it so important?
*   How customer identification is conducted in Colombia
*   Required documents and procedures for KYC compliance
*   Conduct your KYC process with Truora

What is KYC?
------------

KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a set of procedures used by financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers and assess the potential risk of doing business with them.

**This process involves collecting a wide range of information about customers, including their identity, financial activity, and source of funds.** 

The primary objectives of KYC are to prevent:

*   [Fraude](https://blog.truora.com/es/las-lecciones-sobre-reputacion-corporativa-que-nos-ensenaron-los-mayores-escandalos-de-fraude-online).
*   Money laundering. 
*   Terrorist financing.

Why is it so important?
-----------------------

In Colombia, KYC is an indispensable tool for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. As a country with a growing economy and an increasingly sophisticated financial sector, Colombia faces several challenges in financial security. 

Money laundering, in particular, has been a persistent problem due to the presence of criminal groups and organizations seeking to use the financial system to legitimize illicit funds.

### Preventing Fraud and Protecting the Financial System

KYC ensures that financial institutions know their customers and can [identify any suspicious activity](https://blog.truora.com/es/la-importancia-de-las-alianzas-en-la-lucha-contra-el-fraude-online).

By collecting detailed information about customers' identity and financial activity, institutions can detect unusual patterns or suspicious transactions that may indicate criminal activities such as money laundering or terrorist financing. 

This allows them to take preventive measures to avoid the use of their services for illegal activities and protect the integrity of the entire financial system.

### Regulatory Compliance and Responsibility

In addition to preventing fraud and protecting the financial system, KYC is also crucial for ensuring compliance with current regulations in Colombia.

Financial institutions are subject to a series of laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, and KYC compliance is a fundamental requirement to meet these regulations. 

By verifying your customers' identity and collecting information about their financial activity, you stay compliant and avoid penalties from regulatory authorities.

### Strengthening Trust and Transparency

In addition to its benefits in terms of financial security and regulatory compliance, KYC also plays an important role in strengthening trust and transparency in the financial system. 

By demonstrating your commitment to preventing fraud and protecting your customers, you help the sector build trust among consumers and enhance its reputation in the market.

This, in turn, can drive growth and stability for the entire financial system, creating a safer and more reliable environment for all involved.

How is Customer Identification Conducted in Colombia?
-----------------------------------------------------

Customer identification is a critical process carried out in two main ways: 

*   In-person verification
*   Remote verification

Each method has its own characteristics and requirements, but both focus on ensuring the authenticity of the customer's identity and effectively meeting KYC standards.

### In-person Verification

This traditional method requires the customer to physically appear at the financial institution to be identified and verify their identity. This process usually involves presenting original identification documents, such as a citizenship card, identity card, or passport.

Additionally, it may require interviews or signing forms to confirm the authenticity of the provided information.

A key benefit of in-person verification is its level of security and reliability. By interacting directly with the customer, the financial institution's employees can more effectively verify the authenticity of the presented documents and confirm the customer's identity.

This significantly reduces the risk of fraud and ensures that [KYC standars](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc-aml-que-son). adequately met.

### Digital Verification

On the other hand, digital verification has gained popularity in recent years thanks to technological advancements and the growing adoption of online financial services. 

This method allows your customers to complete the identification process without the need to physically visit a bank branch, offering greater convenience and speed.

It is carried out through secure digital platforms that allow customers to upload digital copies of their identification documents and complete the entire process online, including security questions and specific validation actions.

Although digital verification offers advantages in terms of convenience and accessibility, it also presents security challenges. It is crucial for financial institutions to implement robust cybersecurity and identity verification measures to protect the process's integrity. 

This includes using facial recognition technologies, document analysis, and real-time identity verification systems.

Required Documents and Procedures for KYC Compliance in Colombia
----------------------------------------------------------------

ECompliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) in the Colombian financial sector involves collecting various documents and performing specific procedures to verify customers' identity and assess their risk level.

Here are the details:

### 1\. Official Identity Document

The first step for KYC compliance is verifying the customer's identity. 

This requires a valid official identity document, such as a citizenship card, identity card, or passport. These documents are essential to confirm the customer's identity and ensure that the provided information is truthful.

### 2\. Proof of Residence

In addition to the identity document, financial institutions usually require proof of residence to confirm the customer's current address. 

This can include utility bills, bank statements, or other official documents demonstrating the customer's residence. Proof of residence is important to ensure that the information provided by the customer is accurate and up-to-date.

### 3\. Financial Information

In some cases, financial institutions may require additional information about the customer's financial situation as part of the KYC process.

This can include bank statements, proof of income, or any other relevant documentation demonstrating the customer's financial solvency.

This information is crucial for assessing the risk level associated with the customer and determining if they meet the financial institution's requirements.

### 4\. Completion Forms

Besides the required documentation, financial institutions may ask the customer to complete specific forms as part of the KYC process. 

These forms may include questions about:

*   The customer's financial activity.
*   Their credit history.
*   Their sources of income.

Completing these forms is essential to gather additional information and ensure compliance with the financial institution's requirements.

Conversational commerce is a natural response to the demands of modern consumers who seek to establish meaningful relationships through personalized and contextualized conversations.

This evolution has been driven by the convenience and accessibility of [WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp), which allows your company to reach its customers directly and effectively.

In Mexico, the impact of conversational commerce has been particularly notable due to the consolidation of WhatsApp Business as an indispensable tool for companies looking to capitalize on this trend.

That's what I'll talk about today: the relevance of WhatsApp in facilitating efficient two-way communication between companies and customers. In this post, you'll see:

*   The benefits of conversational commerce
*   The growth of WhatsApp Business in Mexico
*   The importance of Click-to-Message in the Mexican Market
*   Artificial intelligence and data analytics to personalize commercial offers
*   Challenges faced by companies in implementing WhatsApp Business

*   Discover Truora's Customer Engagement

The Benefits of Conversational Commerce
---------------------------------------

Conversational commerce offers a series of key benefits that have led to its rapid adoption in Mexico and around the world. Two of these standout benefits are personalization and direct attention, which are transforming the way companies interact with their customers.

### **Personalization**

Personalization is crucial in today's commerce world, where consumers expect tailored experiences that adapt to their individual needs and preferences. 

Conversational commerce allows you to personalize effectively by providing a direct channel for communication between your company and its customers.

Through platforms like [WhatsApp Business](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api), companies can collect data on customer preferences and use artificial intelligence and data analysis to offer highly personalized offers and recommendations.

This not only enhances the customer experience but also increases conversion and loyalty rates.

### **Direct attention**

Direct attention is another key benefit of conversational commerce. Instead of relying on traditional forms of communication such as emails or phone calls, customers can communicate directly with companies through instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

This streamlines the communication process and allows your company to address inquiries and issues quickly and efficiently. Additionally, direct attention creates a sense of closeness and trust between the company and the customer, which can be invaluable for building strong long-term relationships.

### **Potential growth of c-commerce in Mexico**

Conversational commerce has the potential to significantly drive e-commerce growth in Mexico, especially through c-commerce (commerce via messaging channels). 

A [study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/el-empresario/Aumenta-las-ventas-de-tu-pyme-en-300-con-C-commerce-20220114-0084.html) predicts that **c-commerce will represent more than 20% of total online sales in Mexico by 2025.**

This forecast reflects the enormous growth potential offered by conversational commerce in the country and highlights the importance of companies investing in c-commerce solutions to remain competitive in the current market.

### **Relevant References**

A recent study [conducted by Offerwise, a market research company in Latin America](https://marketing4ecommerce.mx/51-de-los-mexicanos-cree-que-hacer-compras-via-whatsapp-es-mas-comodo-offerwise/), found that **more than 50% of Mexican consumers prefer to interact with companies through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.**

This finding underscores the growing importance of c-commerce in the Mexican market and highlights the need for companies to adapt to this trend.

The growth of WhatsApp Business in Mexico
-----------------------------------------

The growth of WhatsApp Business in Mexico has been remarkable. Since its launch, this platform has experienced massive adoption by companies of all sizes and sectors, transforming the way commercial interactions are conducted.

*   According to [Statista](https://es.statista.com/estadisticas/1035031/mexico-porcentaje-de-usuarios-por-red-social/) **92, 2%** of the Mexican population uses WhatsApp, making it the main communication channel for companies with their customers.

### **WhatsApp Flows**

And precisely, flowing with this trend, one of the new features that has generated great interest in the Mexican market is WhatsApp Flows. 

This new feature allows unprecedented customization, offering companies the ability to configure a variety of actions within business chats — from reservations to purchases, through order management and appointment scheduling — through a flow of predefined messages.

By integrating with AI tools and data analytics, WhatsApp Flows allows your company to offer highly personalized user experiences with a focus on usability and accessibility.

Currently, this pioneering solution is in an exclusive pilot phase in Mexico, with the participation of leading companies in their respective sectors, such as Coppel and Farmacias del Ahorro. 

#### **Coppel**

Coppel, one of the largest retail chains in the country, is using the platform to offer exceptional customer service. From resolving product inquiries to facilitating purchase processes, generating loyalty and increasing sales.

#### **Farmacias del Ahorro**

Farmacias del Ahorro is another outstanding example of success in using WhatsApp Business and experimenting with Flows. 

This pharmacy chain was a pioneer in implementing innovative marketing strategies through the platform, launching personalized campaigns that have significantly increased customer engagement and sales.

The importance of Click-to-Message in the Mexican Market
--------------------------------------------------------

The **Click-to-Message** function is the portal that performs the central function of any WhatsApp Marketing strategy: from where leads and customers, lead them to a conversation on WhatsApp.

You can integrate chat buttons directly into your websites or social media profiles, making it easy for customers to start conversations with your company with just one click.

This translates into higher conversion rates and a better customer experience. Click-to-Message offers you a direct way to generate leads and close sales. 

Artificial intelligence and data analytics to personalize commercial offers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics has become a fundamental tool for companies looking to stand out in the Mexican market. 

These technologies allow your company to collect and analyze customer data in real-time, identifying behavioral patterns and preferences that can be used to personalize commercial offers effectively.

### **Artificial Intelligence**

AI is used to automate processes such as audience segmentation, customer profiling, and product or service recommendations. 

By analyzing large volumes of data, AI algorithms can identify trends and behaviors that may go unnoticed by humans, allowing companies to offer personalized offers that resonate with their customers.

### **Analytics**

Data analytics complements AI by providing companies with detailed information about the performance of their campaigns and business strategies.

By monitoring key metrics such as message open rates, response time, and conversion rates, companies can identify areas for improvement and adjust their approach accordingly.

Challenges faced by companies in implementing WhatsApp Business
---------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation of WhatsApp Business presents a series of challenges for companies, from efficiently managing conversations to protecting customer privacy. 

However, with proper strategies and well-planned approaches, it is possible to maximize the potential of this platform in conversational commerce.

### **Efficient conversation management**

With a considerable volume of incoming messages, it is essential to have processes and tools that allow you to manage these interactions effectively.

A key strategy is the automation of responses through the use of [chatbots](https://blog.truora.com/es/crear-un-chatbot-por-whatsapp;), which can provide quick and accurate responses to common inquiries, freeing up staff time to handle more complex cases.

### **Customer privacy protection**

It is crucial to ensure that customer information is handled securely and in compliance with data protection regulations.

Companies must establish clear privacy and security policies, as well as implement technical measures to protect customers' confidential information, such as end-to-end encryption.

  <title>Insurance Industry: How is it transforming in 2024?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/insurance-industry</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_The traditional insurance industry mitigates risks and protects against unexpected losses, but it is also perceived as slow and bureaucratic, leading to frustration among consumers._**

For decades, insurers have been seen as conservative and uninnovative institutions, clinging to traditional processes and outdated systems.

It's not just about [knowing your customers](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc), but also about the fact that acquiring an insurance policy often involves a series of cumbersome procedures and long wait times, which creates friction in the purchasing experience.

This perception of rigidity and lack of agility has led many to seek more modern and efficient alternatives.

With the advent of the digital age and the growing demand for faster and more personalized experiences, traditional insurers have been forced to rethink their approach and adopt new strategies.

It is in this context that the concept of Insurtech emerges as a catalyst for the digital transformation of the insurance industry. That's what I'll talk about today, the disruptive changes these emerging companies are introducing by leveraging technology.

What is Insurtech?
------------------

Insurtech is a term that merges "insurance" and "technology" and arises in response to the need to adapt to a digitized world.

It's the convergence between cutting-edge technology and the insurance industry, giving rise to creative and disruptive solutions that revolutionize the way insurance products and services are conceived, designed, and managed.

### **Some examples**

Insurtechs are harnessing emerging technologies to drive significant changes across the entire value chain of the insurance sector:

*   The **use of IoT devices**, such as sensors installed in cars or wearable devices, allows insurers to collect real-time data on policyholders' behavior and habits.

This not only facilitates a more accurate assessment of risk but also opens the door to the customization of policies and the implementation of fairer and more transparent pricing models.

*   **Artificial intelligence and data analytics** are being used to automate key processes, such as claims assessment and [fraud detection](https://blog.truora.com/es/el-fraude-en-instituciones-financieras-latinoamericanas), reducing operational costs and improving claims management efficiency.

This represents the beginning of a new era in the insurance industry, where technological innovation becomes the engine of transformation and value creation.

We are witnessing the emergence of more agile, personalized and customer-oriented solutions that are redefining the insurance landscape and opening up new opportunities for the industry.

How are Insurtechs introducing disruptive changes in the sector
---------------------------------------------------------------

The insurance industry faces significant challenges, from the increasing [complexity of risks](https://blog.truora.com/es/riesgos-en-las-fintech) to changing customer expectations in the digital age.

Insurtechs are radically transforming the way insurance is conceived and managed. Here are some examples.

### **1 - Facilitating processes and service personalization**

One of the main contributions of Insurtechs lies in their ability to facilitate processes and offer highly personalized and efficient services using digital possibilities.

*   **Comparison and insurance purchase** platforms that allow evaluating different insurance options and provide tools for customization..
*   The use of advanced technologies to **automate processes and offer personalized recommendations.**
*   [Personalized advisory services through chatbots](https://blog.truora.com/es/crear-un-chatbot-por-whatsapp) or virtual assistants, which can help customers better understand their insurance options and make informed decisions in a 24/7 model.

### **2 - Risk assessment**

Insurance companies can use IoT devices installed in cars to collect real-time data on policyholders' driving behavior.

This data includes speed, acceleration, sudden braking and other relevant parameters that help determine a driver's level of risk.

With this information, insurers can adjust premiums more accurately, rewarding cautious drivers with lower rates and promoting road safety.

### **3 - Policy customization**

Using machine learning algorithms to analyze an individual's health history and offer a health insurance policy specifically tailored to their needs and unique risks. 

This means that customers receive coverage and benefits they really need, rather than generic solutions that do not fit their profile.

### **4 - Claims automation**

Another key aspect of Insurtech disruption is the automation of simplified claims processes through WhatsApp and online platforms.

By using AI and data analytics, these startups can streamline and simplify the claims filing and management process, reducing administrative burden for both policyholders and insurance companies.

For example, a customer can file a claim through a mobile app, which uses algorithms to assess the validity of the claim and process it efficiently, all without human intervention.

How digitalization improves UX
------------------------------

In the digital age, customer experience has become a key factor for the success of any business, including the insurance industry.

Digitalization has allowed insurers to significantly improve the way they interact with their customers, offering faster, more transparent, and personalized processes than ever before.

### **Speed and efficiency**

Previously, acquiring an insurance policy or filing a claim could involve a series of cumbersome procedures and long wait times, now customers can request and acquire insurance policies through mobile applications or online platforms in a matter of minutes, eliminating the need for in-person visits to physical branches or long phone calls.

### **Transparency in insurer-client interaction**

Previously, customers could feel frustrated by the lack of clear information about their insurance policies or the status of their claims. With digitalization, all relevant information is easily accessible to customers through mobile applications or online platforms. 

### **UX**

Insurers can use data collected from various sources, such as online browsing histories or purchasing behavior, to offer highly personalized products and services that fit each customer's individual needs and preferences.

The role of chatbots, mobile applications and online platforms
--------------------------------------------------------------

Chatbots, mobile applications, and online platforms play a fundamental role in improving customer experience in the insurance industry.

*   Chatbots can provide instant answers to frequently asked questions and guide customers through complex processes, such as filing claims. 
*   Mobile applications allow your customers to access their policies and make transactions from anywhere, at any time, while online platforms facilitate communication.

How traditional insurers can adapt to this new era
--------------------------------------------------

There is unprecedented pressure on traditional insurers to adapt to this new digital era. Faced with this challenge, insurers have three options:

*   Colaboration with Insurtechs;
*   Investing in your own technological innovation;
*   Hiring a specialized agency.

### **1 - Collaboration with Insurtechs: An opportunity for transformation**

One of the most effective ways your insurance company can adapt to the new era is by partnering with an Insurtech to access advanced technologies and specialized solutions to:

*   Improve operational efficiency, 
*   Offer new products and services to their customers,
*   Stay up to date with the latest technological trends without having to make major investments in internal development,
*   Accelerate their digital transformation and improve business agility by adopting innovative practices and methodologies.

### **2 - Investment in technological innovation: building their own future**

Another option for traditional insurers is to invest in their own technological innovation.

This involves developing and implementing internal initiatives to modernize existing systems and processes, as well as developing new digital solutions and services to meet the changing demands of customers.

While this option may require a significant initial investment and considerable effort in terms of resources and time, it can offer insurers greater control over their digital transformation and allows them to tailor technological solutions to their specific needs and requirements.

### **Challenges related to data privacy and regulation**

The two options above present challenges related to ensuring the protection and security of this information and complying with [strict data privacy regulations](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc-y-pld).

**That's why I saved the best option for last!**

3 - Truora: the safest and most efficient option to transform your company

  <title>Client acquisition: 5 expert tips to reduce CAC</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/client-acquisition</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_The Cost of Customer Acquisition (CAC) is a metric that cannot work against you because it would affect the profitability of your company and its ability to grow and compete. The secret to this is: wherever your customers are, guide them to WhatsApp. I'll talk about that in this article!_**

WhatsApp Commerce is a concept that, despite being relatively new, is widely recognized for its ability to transform how businesses connect with their customers, thereby reducing the Cost of Customer Acquisition (CAC). How does it achieve this? Let me explain.

The cost of acquiring new customers can reach astronomical levels when you consider the significant sums spent on advertising campaigns, digital marketing strategies and other efforts to attract consumer attention. However, these expenditures do not guarantee the conversion of leads into actual customers.

This is where [WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) Commerce comes into play: it offers a unique way to interact with your customers directly, in a personalized and highly effective manner.

By reducing the CAC, increasing retention rates, and stimulating repeat purchases, WhatsApp Commerce optimizes the entire customer journey, providing an exceptional experience from start to finish.

And all of this is accessible within your budget and at your fingertips. That's why it's crucial to **guide your customers to WhatsApp, wherever they may be.**

Today, I'll discuss accessing a new paradigm of customer acquisition that reduces costs, improves efficiency, and, most importantly, fosters strong and lasting relationships with your customers.

In this post, you'll learn about:

*   What is WhatsApp Commerce?
*   5 tips for using WhatsApp Business in customer acquisition
*   Best practices to avoid restrictions 
*   WhatsApp and remote identity verification
*   Reduce your CAC by directing your leads to WhatsApp

What is WhatsApp Commerce?
--------------------------

WhatsApp Commerce **refers to using WhatsApp as a platform for conducting business activities.**

This form of commerce is based on direct communication between businesses and their customers via instant messaging, enabling transactions, providing support, sending sales notifications and promotions, among other commerce-related activities.

**Your company can establish a verified business profile on** [**WhatsApp Business**](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api)**, granting you access to additional features** specifically designed to facilitate commercial interactions.

These features may include the ability to [send automated messages](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-enviar-mensajes-automatizados-por-whatsapp-desde-hubspot), create product catalogs, manage broadcast lists and provide quick responses to customer inquiries.

WhatsApp Business is particularly beneficial for cost reduction as it centralizes communication, simplifies processes, ensures maximum security and seamlessly integrates with each customer's routine.

5 tips for using WhatsApp Business in customer acquisition
----------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's explore the benefits of WhatsApp Business, which is the version created by Meta to empower your company with more sophisticated resources in marketing and sales strategies. 

### **1 - Segment your messages**

Overcoming information overload and reaching your target audience at the right moment is crucial, making segmentation an essential resource. 

By dividing your database into demographic groups, interests or purchasing behaviors, you can personalize your message content to increase relevance and, consequently, conversion rates. 

This precise segmentation allows you to tailor your approach to each group, maximizing the impact of your communications.

#### **1.2 - Segmentation based on the customer journey stage**

I highlight this type of segmentation because it is highly efficient and has its own logic. Each lead is at a different point in their customer journey, which begins with awareness of their need for your solution, followed by evaluation, decision-making, purchase and post-purchase stages.

It's essential to adapt your messages to meet the needs and expectations of each of these stages.

WhatsApp Business enables you to segment your customers based on their position in the journey and deliver personalized messages that align with their interests and specific challenges at that moment, significantly increasing lead conversion possibilities and fostering strong customer relationships.

### **2 - Use multimedia for impactful campaigns**

A picture is worth a thousand words... or is it the other way around? Perhaps it depends on your strategy. Fortunately, WhatsApp offers a variety of multimedia options, including images, videos, and audio files.

From showcasing products to customer testimonials, these tools allow you to convey your message effectively and engagingly, increasing the likelihood of capturing your audience's attention and eliciting a positive response.

### **3 - Implement tracking and analysis to measure campaign effectiveness**

Ultimately, it all comes down to mathematical calculations, which is why metrics are fundamental. 

WhatsApp Business facilitates tracking and analysis of your campaigns by generating reports with various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as:

*   Open rate. 
*   Click-through rate.
*   Conversion rate. 

These insights provide valuable information about your message performance, allowing you to make real-time adjustments to [optimize yout strategy](https://blog.truora.com/es/maximiza-los-resultados-de-tus-estrategias-empresariales-con-la-integracion-de-hubspot-y-whatsapp). By understanding which tactics work best and which need improvement, you can make informed decisions and achieve more robust results.

### **4 - Set up automated drip campaigns**

An automated drip campaign is a series of predefined messages that are automatically sent to users over a period to nurture leads, promote products/services, or proactively provide customer support.

Automation allows you to send messages at specific points in the purchasing cycle, such as after a payment is made, a product is shipped, or a shopping cart is abandoned.

This ensures consistent and relevant presence, increasing conversion chances and strengthening customer relationships.

### **5 - Incorporate interactive elements**

Human interaction is fundamental to motivating individuals, as it is through interaction that satisfaction is built and customers are enchanted and retained.

WhatsApp greatly facilitates this aspect with resources ranging from surveys and questionnaires to call-to-action buttons and quick response options.

By encouraging interaction and engagement, you strengthen that sought-after value—emotional connection.

Following these tips will enhance your customer acquisition efficiency, resulting in a significant decrease in your CAC. Fascinating, isn't it? 

Now, let's talk a little about the precautions you should take to avoid making any mistakes that could jeopardize your WhatsApp campaign.

Best Practices to Avoid Restrictions 
-------------------------------------

The goal of WhatsApp Business is to offer the best experience, and you can be sure of their commitment to that. However, it also demands the same diligence from your company. 

So, be very careful, as a low quality rating can result in restrictions on your ability to send messages or even suspension of your account. 

To avoid these inconveniences, it is essential to know the best practices and ensure that your messages comply with WhatsApp's quality standards. 

This includes:

*   **Voice Tone:** ensure your messages are clear, concise, relevant, and have an appropriate tone of voice.
*   **Relevant and Useful Content:** avoid sending spammy or overly promotional messages, as this can lead to them being marked as unwanted by users.
*   **Moderate Sending Frequency**: do not bombard users with constant messages, as this can be annoying and lead them to block or mark your messages as spam.
*   **Genuine Interaction**: respond promptly to queries and comments from your customers and provide excellent customer service to build trust and loyalty.
*   **Compliance with WhatsApp Policies**: this includes respecting user privacy, prohibiting inappropriate content and complying with local laws and regulations.
*   **Importance of User Feedback:** by collecting feedback and opinions from your users, you can identify areas for improvement and adjust your approach to better meet their needs and expectations. 

WhatsApp and Remote Identity Verification
-----------------------------------------

Now, let's talk about the trust and security environment you should provide to your customers, employees and your company itself. **Remote identity verification is a powerful tool to reinforce this trust and increase customer conversion.** 

Customized solutions for [conducting identity verification processes via WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/beneficios-de-verificar-la-identidad-de-tus-usuarios-por-whatsapp) often involve integrating external tools that allow for remote verification of user identities. 

Here are some ways to implement these solutions:

### **1\. Identity Verification Chatbots**

[Chatbots that interact with users](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente) via WhatsApp to collect information and verify their identity. These chatbots can guide users through a step-by-step verification process, requesting information such as identification documents, photographs, answers to security questions, etc.

### **2\. Integration with Identity Verification Platforms**

Online identity verification services can be integrated with WhatsApp using technologies such as facial recognition, document verification, phone number validation, among others, to remotely verify user identities. 

Integrating with WhatsApp allows these processes to be conducted through the messaging app.

### **3\. WhatsApp Business API** 

WhatsApp Business API allows you to send scheduled and automated messages to your users.

By using this API, businesses can design message flows that include identity verification processes. For example, they can send a message requesting the user to submit a photo of their identification document and then use automated verification tools to validate the received information.

**_Collection is a fundamental process to ensure the financial stability of your company and maintain strong relationships with customers. The challenge is to have an efficient collection process that is also friendly and does not create friction in the user experience. In this article, I'll discuss how to achieve this!

The world of business has changed. Phone calls, emails and letters are outdated and inefficient means of communication. Emails and SMS are heading in the same direction; although they still work, they have lost effectiveness in the face of the rapid advancement of communication.

To this, you must add another determining element that has emerged in recent years: the customer experience. The challenge, therefore, is to achieve maximum efficiency without friction in the user journey when interacting with your company. 

And this is where WhatsApp comes in as the [best channel to communicate with your customers](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) in a natural, friendly and discreet way; allowing you to create a collection strategy with:

*   Quick and efficient interaction.
*   Friendly reminders about due dates.
*   Automation of billing processes.
*   Streamlining the process of generating and sending invoices.
*   Precision and consistency throughout the process. 
*   In addition to developing conversations with Artificial Intelligence to capture data for further personalization of the collection process.

That's why in this post, I talk about the best way you have to implement a friendly collection process that also improves the experience of your users. In this post, you will see:

*   Why you should move away from traditional methods
*   WhatsApp as a familiar, respectful and friendly tool
*   The benefits of preventive collection messages
*   Clear and automated billing processes, the key to success
*   The importance of using cutting-edge technology
*   Make the collection process a memorable experience with Truora

Why move away from traditional methods?
---------------------------------------

It might seem redundant, but it's always worth taking a look back at the rapid changes we've experienced. The quick answer to this question is that traditional methods, such as phone calls, emails and letters have lost their effectiveness.

### **Change in consumer behavior patterns**

This is what I'm talking about regarding the [customer experience](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente), users are constantly bombarded with unwanted calls, unsolicited emails and spam SMS messages that go straight to the trash.

This excess of communication, without the slightest sensitivity, has led to a drastic drop in receptivity to these traditional collection methods.

### Impersonal and outdated

If we add to this the fact that they lack the personalization and adaptability necessary today to address the individual needs of customers, the result is that these methods are the opposite of marketing.

Basically, those who still use them have not entered the era of the customer experience as the axis of business, and, worse, they are missing precious opportunities to increase profitability and retain customers.

WhatsApp as a familiar, respectful and friendly tool
----------------------------------------------------

Our era is marked by two main axes: personalization and immediacy.

*   **Personalization:** because the user prioritizes companies that, in addition to excellent service, offer a special connection, that know their name, that know how to communicate personally with them, and that give them useful advice tailored to their particular reality.
*   **Immediacy:** because the trend is towards the instantaneous, the 24/7 service; the user has less and less tolerance for having to wait and prioritizes companies that value them and do not waste their time.

That's why WhatsApp has become so relevant in the collection process.

### Non-intrusive and respectful contact

With WhatsApp in collections, you can establish non-invasive and respectful contact with customers that adapts to their schedules, allowing for quick and discreet bidirectional communication without interrupting the customer's daily routine or invading their privacy.

### Consumer preference

WhatsApp serves as a filter. It is a platform that provides a lot of security, so users trust it, and that trust transfers to your communication and creates an opportunity.

Customers prefer this type of communication because of its familiarity, which increases the open rate and the likelihood that they will be receptive to the content of your collection messages.

### Personalization and adaptability

And the key advantage of WhatsApp is its development of the WhatsApp Business API, with resources specially developed for companies that will allow you to achieve a level of personalization never seen before.

Users won't see you as a threat reminding them of an uncomfortable moment, but as a collaborator helping them organize their accounts and achieve financial fulfillment.

What are the benefits of preventive collection messages?
--------------------------------------------------------

Now let's talk about the possibilities of automating and capturing data for personalization offered by technological advances so that you can increase your efficiency when collecting and, at the same time, provide more benefits to your users.

### Efficiency and opportunity

One of the main advantages of preventive messages is their ability to improve the efficiency of the process because they are sent automatically at strategic times, such as a gentle reminder from a friend long before the due date.

This also reduces the need for manual intervention and ensures that customers receive the necessary information at the right time.

### Reduction of delinquency

By keeping the customer informed about their financial obligations, you help them organize their pending payments. Trust me when I tell you that this is very important because one of the main pains of users is disorganization.

The user suffers from the experience of wasting their money poorly; if you help them organize themselves, you will gain their preference and also significantly improve on-time payment rates, reducing the need for unpleasant collection actions.

### Practical examples of effective messages

Here are some practical examples of effective collection messages:

**Due Date Reminder:**

_“Hello \[Customer's Name\] 🙂, just a friendly reminder that your invoice is due in 3 days. You can easily and securely pay through our online portal or, if you prefer, on our app to negotiate an installment and modify the due date 😎. Thanks for your attention!"_

**Payment Flexibility Offer:**

_"Dear \[Customer's Name\], we understand that financial difficulties can arise. Do you need help finding a payment solution that suits your needs? 🤔 We're here to help 💪. Contact us to discuss options."_

**Thank You for Payment:**

_“Hi \[Customer's Name\]! We want to thank you for your punctual payment. 😀 Your commitment to us is invaluable. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thanks again!"_

Clear and Automated Billing Processes, the Key to Success
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to collection messages, clear and automated billing processes are essential to maintaining efficiency and transparency in the collection process.

*   **Detailed and easy-to-understand invoices:** to avoid confusion and ambiguities and facilitate the payment process.
*   **Flexible payment options:** such as online payments, bank transfers or payment plans to increase the chances of them paying on time.

The importance of using cutting-edge technology in 2024
-------------------------------------------------------

And finally, I'll discuss the importance of leveraging cutting-edge technology to transform the collection process into a competitive advantage that not only ensures profitability but also positions you in the minds of your users as a trusted reference.

Technology is the gateway to the following benefits I'll mention below.

### Building stronger relationships

A personalized approach to collections involves treating each customer as unique, understanding their individual needs and adapting the collection strategy accordingly. This fosters long-term loyalty.

### More data for personalization

Through data analysis and the use of Artificial Intelligence tools, you can gather detailed information about your customers' payment habits, communication preferences and financial situations, enabling you to personalize your collection strategies more effectively.

### Automation and efficiency

In addition to personalization, technology also enables process automation in collections, improving efficiency and reducing manual workload for employees, freeing up time and resources that can be devoted to more strategic activities.

### **Integration of communication channels - omnichannel**

Another important aspect of a technologically advanced approach to collections is the integration of multiple communication channels. This allows you to lead your customers from any channel, be it email, social media or SMS, to a conversation via WhatsApp.

### Customer security and trust

Furthermore, advanced technology in collections also brings benefits in terms of customer security and trust.

Secure online payment systems and data protection measures ensure that customers' financial information is protected at all times, contributing to a safer and more transparent collection experience.

### **Adaptation to changing market needs**

It is essential to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies to be better positioned and build strong relationships with customers, improve operational efficiency and ensure the long-term financial health of your company.

  <title>Fraud prevention: what is it and how to avoid it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/fraud-prevention</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

If you are reading this, probably you are a member of a company that uses e-commerce to sell its products, or you work in a FinTech/banking company, or maybe you are only a frequent user of these types of websites.

What do all these people have in common? They want that **every transaction** that they do through these websites or mobile apps is **secured** and **not exposed to any kind of fraud.** 

To do this, is important for those FinTech, banking, and e-commerce companies to fully understand how to **prevent and detect fraud** in their operations? Which **kinds of frauds** do exist? And what **kind of tools are available** to minimize the risk of being attacked by malicious people? 

All to prevent **loss of clients and reputations** while ensuring **security** and **affordability**. 

This post is going to present you with a set of tools to keep **your sites and users safe** and how you, as a user, can identify safe webs for your financial peace. But first, we have to take a closer look at what is fraud prevention, fraud detection, and kinds of fraud in our current digital era.  

[Learn how to reach new customers with WhatsApp Marketing](https://blog.truora.com/en/whatsapp-marketing)

Fraud prevention could be defined as the implementation of strategies or mechanisms to prevent fraudulent transactions and prevent these actions from causing financial and **reputational damage** to financial institutions or customers.  

In a few words: **fraud prevention occurs before the fraud attempt** and its goal is to **reduce the risk** of future fraud operations.

To have a clear view of the problem of fraud in the digital sector here are some relevant statistics:

To **minimize** this loss of money, reputation, and trust of the FinTech, banking, and e-commerce companies; **fraud prevention**, and **fraud detection** methods have to be continuously deployed to increase the security levels. 

Mechanisms that use **machine learning** and **artificial intelligence** algorithms, or other **software** are currently developed and implemented to **protect businesses and customers** from this.

However, it’s important to make clear that fraud prevention and fraud detections are two **different sets of tools** that companies exposed to digital fraud could implement. Companies can enforce the first ones or the second ones, or the two of them depending on which kind of fraud attempts are they **most exposed to**. The below image shows what are the main differences between fraud detection and prevention.

Usually, when new customers are exposed to fraud in a website, t[hey rarely come back and expend more money in this site](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-fraud-prevention). Because of these fraudulent practices, not only criminals are stealing from you, but they are **wrecking your online reputation**, damaging your **brand**, and hurting your profits.

  
[Is WhatsApp safe? All you need to know about the app security](https://blog.truora.com/en/is-whatsapp-safe-to-use)

**Types of fraud in e-commerce and the financial sector**
---------------------------------------------------------

Fraud in a digital era is **not only stealing money** through websites transactions, and is not only practiced by hackers, scammers, or online criminals, **some unscrupulous customers** use tactics such as **friendly fraud** (when users claim that the product wasn’t delivered), or **refund abuse** (when costumers return broken or damage products) to take advantage of your trust.

Taking into account that only visa process more than 29 million online transactions daily, there are plenty of chances for lawbreakers to intercept payments. Because of that, let’s take a look at the main 4 types of e-commerce fraud to which websites are exposed.

### **Card testing fraud**

Card testing is the second most popular type of fraud in all sectors. This fraud is presented when scammers test if a stolen credit card works. Lawbreakers make small and low-value purchases to see if the transactions go under the radar of the cardholder. When they know that a card is still working, scammers make more expensive purchases.

### **Online payment fraud**

Scammers duplicate versions of popular websites and make customers purchase items through fake sites. Hijackers take their cash and store their credit card number for future payments.

### **Phishing**

Phishing can be described as an account takeover that takes place when criminals break into an online account and use the store payment methods to make fraudulent purchases.

### **Triangulation fraud**

This type of fraud has three main steps:

*   Create a fake online storefront to steal names, addresses, and credit card information (same as online payment fraud)
*   Scammers go and buy exactly what the victim purchased and ship it to the customer to prevent raising suspicious from the customer
*   Finally, lawbreakers use the stolen customer data to make additional online purchases that they ship to themselves

**What are fraud prevention methods?**
--------------------------------------

There are different tools, mechanisms, methods, and fraud prevention solutions to address each one of the previously discussed types of fraud. 

It’s important that you select the ones that are closely related to solving the fraud that your e-commerce, FinTech, or banking company is suffering from. 

Here’s a selection of the most common practices:

*   Make an audit of your site security regularly.
*   Take extra cautions around peak shopping season.
*   Use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) on your websites.
*   Make sure your e-commerce is PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant. 
*   All purchases need Card Verification Value (CVV) numbers.
*   Set limits on purchases (value and items).
*   Check that the IP address and credit card address match.
*   Use customer verification software.

  <title>Challenges of virtual identity in banking: what are they?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/challenges-of-identity-validation-in-banking</url>
  <content>**_The user experience is the lens through which digital businesses are viewed. It must be memorable, simple, and secure. The main challenge: Ensuring that the identity validation process not only does not create friction but also adds value. I'll explain how in this post about the challenges of virtual identity!_**

It's very challenging to talk about the challenges and KYC processes without sounding repetitive or redundant since we're dealing with landscapes that we already know, among them stand out that:

*   Digital transformation democratized access to banking services, granting an **unprecedented user experience**, which became the **main asset and benchmark.**
*   At the same time, **security risks** increased**.**
*   **To mitigate these risks,** companies need to **validate the identity** of their users, thus avoiding fraud and impersonation. And so it begins again, **because without an optimized identity validation process, the customer experience could be compromised.**

Therefore, Truora's value proposition is based on making digital identity validation a factor that adds value to the user experience from the outset.

Today, I will discuss the challenges of identity validation in banking and how to transform that process into a competitive advantage.

In this article, you will see:

*   The urgency of streamlining KYC as a competitive advantage
*   The 10 challenges of virtual identity validation in banking
*   The connection between financial growth in Colombia and digital trust
*   Make identity validation a differential

The urgency of streamlining KYC as a competitive advantage
----------------------------------------------------------

Manual processes and the lack of agility in identity validation are the main sources of friction, inefficiencies, and obstacles.

Having to present physical documents, attend in-person meetings, and carry out multiple procedures is frustrating. Users already know that technology exists to solve these problems and prefer fintech companies that are up to date.

That's why technologies like biometrics or facial recognition, which streamline and simplify KYC processes, are a priority for fintech companies. This way, they can provide a fast and positive experience to their users.

The 10 challenges of virtual identity validation in banking
-----------------------------------------------------------

Identity validation serves as the protective shield for fintech companies and their users against threats such as fraud, identity theft, and hackers. At the same time, it presents the challenge of maintaining a balance between customer convenience and the security of their transactions.

### **1 - Implementation**

Transforming an analog culture into a digital one is much more than just software and technology; it's a matter of mindset and habits.

**\#** It needs to overcome resistance to change, to the new, to the unknown, both from users and from the people working in the fintech.

**\#** It requires a careful transition from traditional authentication methods to more agile and secure systems.

**\#** It involves the development of innovative technologies that utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning, and biometrics.

**\#** It must ensure compatibility with regulatory and security standards established by financial authorities.

### **2 - Omnichannel integration**

It is crucial to offer omnichannel support. In this case, the challenge lies in consistency, unifying the user experience by providing a secure service regardless of the channel they choose to interact with your fintech.

Allow your users to access and manage their accounts seamlessly, with security and convenience in every interaction.

**The challenges are:**

**\#** Synchronizing identity verification methods

**\#** Working seamlessly across all environments.

**#** Balancing the robustness of authentication with ease of use.

### **3 - Efficiency**

The accessory only adds value if the core is efficient. The big challenge is implementing a system that, in addition to validating, combats persistent threats such as:

#### **Malware**

Malicious software designed to damage, access, or control a computer system without the owner's consent can affect digital validation in several ways:

*   **Personal data theft:** passwords, credit card numbers, and identification data.
*   **Identity theft:** creating fake profiles or engaging in fraudulent activities on behalf of the victim.
*   **Unauthorized access:** to online accounts, allowing unauthorized transactions.
*   **Session hijacking:** taking control of active online sessions.

#### **Phishing**

It's a technique used to deceive and obtain confidential information, and it can have a significant impact on the following:

*   **Fraudulent data acquisition:** tricking victims into revealing this information on fake websites or emails.
*   **Identity theft:** impersonating legitimate entities to gain access to accounts.

#### **Hacking**

It is the invasion of computer systems or networks and can have serious consequences such as:

*   **Unauthorized access to sensitive data:** obtaining personal information through vulnerabilities in systems.
*   **Data manipulation:** modifying, stealing, or destroying personal data, affecting the integrity of the information used in validation processes.

### **4 - Adapting to regulations**

The challenge in this item is the constant updating. It is practically a global consensus on the need to legislate the digital economy, with a focus on data protection. Compliance with these regulations requires:

**\#** Strict and sophisticated identity validation to ensure transparency, security, and regulatory compliance.

**\#** Close collaboration with regulatory entities to ensure that identity validation methods meet established standards.

### **5 - Sustainability**

Another challenge is aligning all your efforts with a purpose of social responsibility. Digital validation can positively impact the environment in several ways:

**\# Paper reduction:** less deforestation and a smaller carbon footprint associated with paper production and disposal.

**\# Lower consumption of physical resources:** such as offices and storage spaces.

**\# Reduced carbon footprint:** reduces the need for transportation and traffic congestion.

**\# Energy efficiency:** by reducing the need for physical equipment and using cloud resources, they are more energy-efficient.

### **6 - Adapting to new payment methods**

This includes digital currencies, digital wallets, and fast cross-border payments.

**#** Incorporating **digital currencies and wallets** requires adapted security protocols, with emphasis on secure authentication and data protection in decentralized environments.

**\#** Fast **cross-border payments** pose additional challenges in identity validation due to varied regulations and the diversity of financial systems between countries.

### **7 - Integrating blockchain**

Digital validation and blockchain technology can collaborate in various circumstances to strengthen security, authentication, and online identity management.

Here are some situations where both can work together:

**\# Decentralized identity systems:** where individuals have control over their own digital identity, verified and managed in a decentralized and secure manner.

**\# Smart contracts:** on the blockchain can enable automatic and secure validation of identity, without compromising personal data.

### **8 - Open Finance**

The challenge here lies in allowing users to authorize third parties to perform operations or access specific private information.

**\#** The key is to develop robust authentication systems that allow users to grant and revoke permissions securely, ensuring that only authorized information is shared with third parties.

### **9 - Privacy**

The privacy of digital validation is crucial for the user experience and must ensure the protection of sensitive data while confirming user authenticity.

The main difficulty lies in developing authentication systems that maintain the confidentiality of personal information, avoiding vulnerabilities and ensuring that data is not compromised at any point in the process.

### **10 - Interoperability in Financial Digital Environments**

And, finally, the challenge of interoperability in financial digital environments to ensure that identity validation systems are compatible and work seamlessly across different platforms and financial entities.

To ensure that this integration does not create friction, standardized protocols are necessary to enable efficient and secure sharing and verification of user information. 

The connection between financial growth in Colombia and digital trust
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The financial sector in Colombia is experiencing significant growth, largely driven by digital trust among consumers and the rapid adoption of digital channels for financial transactions.

This shift in consumer behavior has been a key factor in the evolution and development of the country's financial landscape.

### Trust as an Asset

Identity validation is the fundamental pillar of this trust because it ensures security in financial transactions.

By accurately and securely verifying the identity of each individual in transactions, the risk of fraud and identity theft is significantly reduced.

### Validation as the engine of the economy

The trust generated by identity validation translates into increased economic activity, as users are more willing to take advantage of digital opportunities without fears, such as:

**#** Making investments;

**\#** Taking loans;

**#** Engaging in various financial transactions.

  <title>KYC in Colombia: what is needed to comply with it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/kyc-in-colombia</url>
  <content>**_Compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) in Colombia is a cornerstone for the proper and ethical functioning of financial institutions: it is the link that establishes a relationship of trust between financial entities and their clients. In this post, I discuss everything about this topic!_**

[KYC](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc) in Colombia is a crucial mechanism for maintaining transparency and preventing illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing in the financial system.

As its name suggests, Know Your Customer (KYC) focuses on the fundamental principle of understanding the users of financial services and deeply comprehending:

*   Who they are.
*   What their financial activities are.
*   What their needs are.

This not only involves verifying their identity and financial history but also continuously monitoring their transactions to detect any suspicious activity.

KYC protects financial institutions from being used for criminal activities, safeguards the integrity of the financial system as a whole, and protects the customers themselves.

And it is precisely for these three reasons that it has become a fundamental element in the field of digital business. That's what I'll talk about today, the KYC process in Colombia, and the necessary steps to carry it out. In this article, you will see:

*   What KYC is
*   Why it is so relevant
*   How customer identification is carried out in Colombia
*   Documents and procedures required to comply with KYC
*   Carry out your KYC process with Truora

What is KYC?
------------

KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a set of procedures used by financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers and assess the potential risk of doing business with them.

This process involves collecting a wide range of information about customers, including their identity, financial activity and source of funds.

The main objectives of KYC are to prevent:

*   [Fraud](https://blog.truora.com/es/las-lecciones-sobre-reputacion-corporativa-que-nos-ensenaron-los-mayores-escandalos-de-fraude-online)
*   Money laundering
*   Terrorism financing

Why is it so relevant?
----------------------

In Colombia, KYC is an indispensable tool for combating money laundering and terrorism financing. As a country with a growing economy and an increasingly sophisticated financial sector, it faces a number of challenges in terms of financial security.

Money laundering, in particular, has been a persistent problem due to the presence of criminal groups and organizations seeking to use the financial system to legitimize illicit funds.

### Preventing fraud and protecting the financial system

KYC ensures that financial institutions know their customers and can identify any suspicious activity.

By collecting detailed information about customers' identities and financial activity, institutions can detect unusual patterns or suspicious transactions that may indicate criminal activities such as money laundering or terrorism financing. 

This allows them to take preventive measures to prevent their services from being used for illicit activities and to protect the integrity of the financial system as a whole.

### Regulatory compliance and responsibility

In addition to preventing fraud and protecting the financial system, KYC is also crucial for ensuring compliance with current regulations and regulations in Colombia.

Financial institutions are subject to a number of laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, and KYC compliance is a fundamental requirement for compliance with these regulations.

By verifying the identity of your customers and collecting information about their financial activity, you are up to date with compliance and avoid sanctions from regulatory authorities.

### Building trust and transparency

In addition to its benefits in terms of financial security and regulatory compliance, KYC also plays an important role in strengthening trust and transparency in the financial system.

By demonstrating your commitment to preventing fraud and protecting your customers, you help the sector build trust among consumers and strengthen its reputation in the market.

This, in turn, can drive growth and stability in the financial system as a whole, creating a safer and more reliable environment for all involved.

How is customer identification carried out in Colombia?
-------------------------------------------------------

Customer identification is a critical process that is carried out in two main ways:

*   In-person verification.
*   Remote verification. 

Each method has its own characteristics and requirements, but both focus on ensuring the authenticity of the customer's identity and complying with KYC standards effectively.

### In-person verification

This is a traditional method that requires the customer to physically present themselves at the financial institution to be identified and verify their identity. This process usually involves presenting original identity documents, such as the citizenship card, identity card or passport.

Additionally, it may require interviews or signing forms to confirm the authenticity of the information provided.

One of the key benefits of in-person verification is its level of security and reliability. By interacting directly with the customer, employees of the financial institution can more effectively verify the authenticity of the documents presented and confirm the customer's identity.

This significantly reduces the risk of fraud and ensures that adecuadamente [KYC standards](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc-aml-que-son) are properly met. 

### Digital verification

On the other hand, digital verification has gained popularity in recent years thanks to technological advancements and the increasing adoption of online financial services.

This method allows your customers to complete the identification process without the need to physically visit a bank branch, offering greater convenience and agility.

It is carried out through secure digital platforms that allow customers to upload digital copies of their identity documents and complete the entire process online, including security questions and specific validation actions.

Although digital verification offers advantages in terms of convenience and accessibility, it also poses challenges in terms of security. It is essential for financial institutions to implement robust cybersecurity measures and identity verification to protect the integrity of the process. 

This includes the use of facial recognition technologies, document analysis, and real-time identity verification systems.

Documents and procedures required to comply with KYC in Colombia
----------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) in the Colombian financial industry involves collecting various documents and conducting specific procedures to verify customers' identities and assess their level of risk. 

Here are the details:

### 1\. Official identification document

The first step in KYC compliance is verifying the customer's identity. 

To do this, a valid official identification document, such as the citizenship card, identity card or passport, is required. These documents are essential to confirm the customer's identity and ensure that the information provided is truthful.

### 2\. Proof of residence

In addition to the identification document, financial institutions usually require proof of residence to confirm the customer's current address. 

This may include utility bills, bank statements or other official documents demonstrating the customer's residence. Proof of residence is important to ensure that the information provided by the customer is accurate and up to date.

### 3\. Financial information

In some cases, financial institutions may require additional information about the customer's financial situation as part of the KYC process.

This may include bank statements, income statements or any other relevant documentation demonstrating the customer's financial solvency.

This information is crucial for assessing the level of risk associated with the customer and determining whether they meet the financial institution's requirements.

   

### 4\. Completion forms

In addition to the required documentation, financial institutions may require the customer to complete specific forms as part of the KYC process.

These forms may include questions about the customer's financial activity, credit history or sources of income.

*   The financial activity of the client.
*   Their credit history.  
*   Their sources of income

Filling out these forms is essential for collecting additional information and ensuring compliance with the financial institution's requirements.

  <title>Automated payment using chatbots: how to incentivize it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/pago-automatizado-0</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Delinquency and non-payment, also known as overdue accounts, are very serious issues that jeopardize the financial health of companies. That's why chatbots in e-commerce strategies have become so relevant. Are you interested? In this post, I'll tell you all about it.

Late payments are a constant concern that can lead a company to close its operations. Additionally, their management consumes valuable resources and, as if that weren't enough, can generate tensions in customer relationships.

Luckly, in the midst of this challenge, technology managed to generate an innovative solution that leaves the market hopeful: **chatbots**. 

These tools leverage the growing relevance of conversational commerce (c-commerce) and [platforms like WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp), to improve efficiency when collecting payments without harming the customer experience.

Let me present you the three characters of this article:

*   **Late payments**, a real threat that can hinder a company's ability to meet its own financial commitments and whose collection consumes valuable resources.
*   **Chatbots**, a market's technological response to automate much of the collection process.
*   **Contactability:** with a reach of over 90% in Latin America and an incredible [open rate of 98%](https://forbescentroamerica.com/2019/08/22/whatsapp-y-su-inmenso-potencial-para-los-mass-media) and over 80% message read rate within the first 5 minutes.

That's what I'll talk about today, the importance of integrating chatbots into your conversational collection strategy and avoiding the headaches of this worrying problem. In this post, you'll see:

*   Overdue accounts in numbers
*   Chatbots and contactability as the axis of prompt payment and collections
*   A few examples of collection messages and special offers to incentivize prompt payment 
*   How omnichannel strategy and personalization improve the customer experience and efficiency in collections

Late payments represent one of the most pressing challenges for companies worldwide. Below, we'll present some revealing statistics and their impact on companies.

According to Alan Ramírez, CEO of Coperva in an artículo from [Forbes México](https://www.forbes.com.mx/cartera-vencida-y-la-peligrosa-piramide-del-credito/):

*   _Overdue accounts are the 3rd leading cause of small and midsize enterprises closures._ 

*   _From May 2019 to July 2021, 1,583,930 units closed, representing a decrease of 396,761 establishments._

*   _57% of Mexican companies face this problem, especially in sectors like automotive credit, banks, and real estate._

*   _Revenue loss in overdue accounts can reach up to 33% for individuals and businesses._

According to a study by [Atradius](https://www.creditoycaucion.es/br/cycnews/analisis/detalle/4745), a global credit insurance operator present in 50 countries providing information to protect companies from payment risks:

*   _33% of companies in Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States face liquidity problems due to delays in collecting their commercial operations.  
    _

*   _95% of these companies experience delays in paying B2B invoices, both from domestic and foreign clients._

*   _In Mexico, 54% of companies face delays in payments from domestic clients._

*   _Over 45% of domestic invoices are overdue beyond the due date, highlighting additional challenges companies face._

### The impact of a preventive strategy

Prevention is more efficient than correction; late payments require a lot of work

1.  **Recovery:** the process of recovering funds from loans that are in default or considered uncollectible, involving a variety of strategies that range from direct contact with the debtor to legal action, and will require specialized personnel in negotiations, collections and, in some cases, legal procedures.
2.  **Written-off Portfolio:** also known as a deteriorated or delinquent portfolio, it refers to loans that are in a prolonged state of default and are considered unlikely to be fully recovered.

With a preventive approach, you can generate reminders, alerts or payment options to minimize losses.

Chatbots and contactability as the axis of prompt payment and collections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's get to the interesting part, which is when I tell you that there is a way out of this situation. Much of the issue of delinquency, especially among individuals, is not due to ill will but to a lack of organization.

The digital market advanced so quickly that it created an illusion of solvency that became for many users and companies a debt pyramid, falling into a vicious, impoverishing circle of taking on debt to pay debt.

And this is where the innovative approach comes in, leveraging c-commerce channels to guide your users in their decisions. We could call it a preventive approach.

### Optimizing collection with chatbots on WhatsApp

[Chatbots integrated with WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-transferir-tus-conversaciones-de-un-chatbot-de-whatsapp-a-un-humano-con-hubspot) give you the ability to refine your collection processes, providing you with an efficient way to send payment reminders and develop more direct and personalized communication with your customers. 

### Automated payment reminders

One of the main functions of chatbots on WhatsApp are the automated reminders of payment.

These reminders can be configured to be sent at strategic moments, such as the eve of a bill's due date. This ensures that customers receive timely and accurate reminders, increasing the likelihood of them paying on time.

### Message personalization

Personalization in the digital age goes much further than putting the user's name in a message, it involves a level of data collection and analysis that lets your company know more about their finances than the user himself.

Bots can process customer data, such as payment history and communication preferences, to adapt to their individual needs and provide more relevant guidance, increasing the effectiveness of payment reminders.

### Real-time interaction

Another advantage of chatbots on WhatsApp is the ability to [interact in real-time with customers.](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente). 

In addition to sending automated payment reminders, bots can also respond to inquiries and provide real-time assistance, giving your customers quick answers to their payment questions or efficiently solving problems, without having to wait for a human representative to be available.

This sense of timeliness can be the difference between taking on another debt that will directly compete with what they owe to your company or not.

### Tracking and analysis of results

Furthermore, chatbots on WhatsApp can also track and analyze the results of communications.

The bots can gather data on the effectiveness of collection messages, such as open rates, providing you with detailed reports so you can evaluate the performance of your collection strategy and make adjustments as necessary to improve effectiveness.

Some examples of collection messages and special offers to incentivize prompt payment 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective communication plays a crucial role in incentivizing customers to avoid delays. It's true that you need to be very clear in what you want to communicate, but you can also add value with useful information or offer special deals to motivate them.

Here are a few examples:

*   ### Payment Incentive Message
    

_“Hi \[Customer's Name\]! We want to remind you that your invoice number \[Invoice Number\] is pending payment. Don't forget that if you need to negotiate, you can do it in our App, the process is very simple. Make sure to keep your account up to date so you don't miss out on any offers! If you have any questions about your invoice or need help making the payment, we're here to assist you" 🙂_

*   ### Payment Reminder Message with Discount
    

“Dear \[Customer's Name\], we want to remind you that your invoice number \[Invoice Number\] is due on \[Due Date\]. As a thank you for your punctuality, we offer you a 10% discount on your next purchase. 😎 Seize this opportunity and make sure to keep your account up to date so your money goes further! For more details, feel free to contact us".

*   ### Thank You Message for Prompt Payment with Discount Coupon
    

_"Hi \[Customer's Name\]! We want to thank you for your prompt payment of invoice number \[Invoice Number\]. Your commitment is invaluable to us, so we're sending you a 10% discount coupon for your next purchase. Enjoy it and thank you for choosing us! 🙂 If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us"._

How omnichannel strategy and personalization improve the customer experience and efficiency in collections
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, I'll talk about omnichannel as a fundamental concept for achieving the best results. The strategic idea is: provide attention to your users on any channel and lead them to WhatsApp where you can have a more persuasive and efficient conversation.

*   ### Improving collection efficiency
    

To begin with, by leading them to WhatsApp you'll be able to take advantage of all the resources that WhatsApp Business API continuously develops to increase efficiency. This means you'll have access to data, reports and a level of personalization never seen before.

At the same time, you'll save your team time and your company's resources that you can apply to more strategic points.

*   ### **Generate better solutions for the user**
    

The data you gather combined with the trust and familiarity of WhatsApp results in a different type of connection that allows you to offer tailored alternatives to each user at the most opportune moment.

By collecting, analyzing and processing data with advanced algorithms, your messages will exponentially increase their relevance, becoming a valuable aid in organizing finances.

*   ### Frictionless payment experience
    

Lastly, the most important thing is to make the payment a good experience, showing that your company works so that the user can enjoy their financial well-being without uncomfortable or unpleasant moments.

Making payment a happy moment is perhaps the greatest achievement of all time for the business world!

  <title>How to prospect clients via WhatsApp in 2024: Learn in 14 tips</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/how-to-prospect-clients-via-whatsapp</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

I prospect, you prospect, he prospects. Conjugating the verb "to prospect" is fundamental in marketing. The problem is that we usually see this word as a noun, "the prospect," synonymous with a lead, and not as a verb that increases sales.

Prospecting means exploring future possibilities based on present clues. It is an action that, in the era of data economy, has become increasingly precise.

Today we are going to explain this subtlety so that you learn how to prospect clients through [**WhatsApp**](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) with the best results, which is ultimately what interests you.

Let's dive into the topic!

Difference between lead and prospect
------------------------------------

o begin, let's clarify two concepts that are often assumed to be synonymous but have a significant difference.

Both refer to a potential client, but while:

*   A prospect is the result of a projection based on a market study;
*   A lead is a condition resulting from a problem that a person has and that you can solve.

### What comes first: the prospect or the lead?

Therefore, to prospect is to define how, when and where will be approach the leads. 

We can also use a timeline to differenciate them. Let´s say we first proyect everything refered to our ideal clients and then we take actions to capture them. 

**Market ⇨ Prospect ⇨ Lead ⇨ Qualified lead ⇨ CLIENT ⇨ Fidelization**

So, the order is as follows: 

1.  market research;
2.  lead prospecting;
3.  lead capture using the sales funnel;
4.  sale;
5.  \*during the sale, support and customer service;
6.  \*afterward, all the work of customer retention in the after-sale.

The good news is that WhatsApp is an ideal ally for all of these moments. But let´s stay in the prospecting to understand more detalis. Keep reading! 

Why prospect?
-------------

Basically, we prospect to avoid making the main mistake in marketing and sales, inadequacy.

Offering your product to an audience that doesn't have the problem your solution solves. It's like inviting a group of vegans to a barbecue; no matter how hard you try, your dishes will never satisfy that audience.

Therefore, if you have a business based on dishes with animal protein, you already have an element to start prospecting your clients: your product is not for vegans.

Next, we're going to give you golden tips so you can prospect your clients via WhatsApp efficiently and with results.

How to prospect clients via WhatsApp: 14 golden tips
----------------------------------------------------

Let us begin our journey of tips so you can apply this knowledge.

### 1\. Create your buyer persona before prospecting

To begin with, the most important thing is never to work in general; we need a specific client to guide and tailor our actions. For that, there is a tool called a buyer persona that makes a difference in the digital experience.

The buyer persona is a creation of a fictional character based on real information from your customers. It will tell you the tone of voice to use, the best times to send offers, and the main pains of your prospects, among many other data.

Think of this tool as a guide that will accompany you throughout the implementation process of your messaging strategy.

### 2\. Define your customer journey.

Now comes the part of where: at what stage of the customer journey does communication via WhatsApp facilitate or resolve issues.

Don't be afraid of this step because it's not an impossible mission. All you need to do is imagine the entire path your prospect takes from recognizing their distress to purchasing your product.

Ask your buyer persona which social media platform they use, if they search on Google before making a purchase, [what do they value most about customer service and support](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente), etc.  That way, you'll know where to place the link to your WhatsApp chat.

### 3\. Think of your messages as content

Many people don't understand it, but literature has its role in performance. For example, it's not the same to simply sell as it is to create a shopping experience that leaves a positive memory in your customer's mind.

*   In the first option, our interest is selfish and without dimension; it starts and ends with our goal, which is to expedite the sale.
*   In the second option, our interest is altruistic, to generate value for the customer so that the purchase is a natural consequence. 

### 4\. Create WhatsApp campaigns in Facebook Ads.

And if we talk about WhatsApp, we also talk about Facebook, as both platforms, along with Instagram, are part of Meta. That's why communication between them is simplified with just 1 click.

Sometimes it may seem like Facebook is already history and Instagram is the present, but the undeniable truth is the strength that the queen of social networks still holds. That's why it's essential to know the age of your buyer persona when choosing the social network you're going to use.

The Facebook Ads Manager allows you to include WhatsApp as one of the communication channels that users can opt for. They see an ad on Facebook, and with just 1 click, they're chatting with you on WhatsApp. A great opportunity, isn't it? You can perform the integration here.

### 5\. Believe in the power of personalization

There's an old saying in marketing that goes: the word people like to hear the most is their own name.

Receiving a message that addresses us directly by our name creates a more direct relationship and increases the chances of it being read, as well as satisfaction with the attention received.

Don't forget that security is one of the main topics; personalization works because it creates a kind of more intimate and trustworthy bond. Plus, it can be automated.

### 6\. Create an omnichannel communication

And to continue, there's the famous omnichannel, which we could define like this: all roads lead to your WhatsApp!

Think about it, we're in an era where we have to think about communication engineering; if you master that, you've already covered 80% of the journey.

Nothing better for a customer than giving them the option to move from one platform to another without feeling the difference. For that, you'll need a platform that integrates all channels and allows you to manage them from a single _dashboard_.

### 7\. Hold giveaways.

Now let's go to classic ideas for capturing WhatsApp numbers and generating communication between your company and the audience you have targeted.

You already know where they are, how old they are, how to reach them, it's time to create a focal point to get discovered. It's time to give away a sample of your service/product.

For example, you can give away a discount or a giftcard in products, it's a way to create a prize that won't cause you extra shipping expenses. Make providing a phone number a condition and offer a direct link to your WhatsApp.

### 8\. Invest in loyalty techniques

Write this down: it's cheaper to retain a customer than to acquire a new one. The logic of loyalty is relationship marketing, a non-invasive marketing type that focuses on creating a bond to nurture and educate customers so they can make better use of their money.

The more familiar they are with your company, the better they buy, and the more their money is worth! To give an air of exclusivity, nothing beats a VIP group or mailing list for certain customers, notifying them of promotions. Nobody minds messages that help them save money.

### 9\. Offer "limited" samples.

In the chapter of mental triggers or psychological triggers, we have a classic: the sense of urgency. Add to that a well-built contact list and a connection through WhatsApp.

For a limited time, last products, until stock runs out, the first 100, only today until 23:59, among other phrases, convey that sense of urgency that precipitates a decision.

### 10\. Create a product catalog in WhatsApp Business.

WhatsApp Business is a powerful tool for prospecting clients. One of its standout features is the ability to create a product catalog. By having your products and services organized and easily accessible within the application, you significantly increase the visibility of what you offer.

When a potential customer contacts you, this catalog acts as a virtual storefront, allowing them to explore your items efficiently and attractively. This strategy not only enhances the customer experience but also streamlines the sales process.

### 11\. Configure automatic messages in WhatsApp Business.

Automatic messages in WhatsApp Business are essential for maintaining fluid and efficient communication with customers. These messages can be configured to respond to common inquiries or to offer self-help options when you are not available.

For example, an automatic message can guide customers to choose options based on their needs, such as information about products, assistance with orders, or speaking with a representative. This strategy not only optimizes the sales flow but also enhances the customer experience by providing quick and relevant responses.

### 12\. Have exclusive offers for WhatsApp customers.

To increase the effectiveness of your sales on WhatsApp, consider designing exclusive offers for your customers on this platform. Following the principle that consumers prefer to buy from brands that offer personalization and recognition, you can create a group of special offers for new customers.

This not only makes them feel valued but also fosters loyalty toward your brand. Make sure to obtain their consent before sending these offers to maintain a respectful and professional relationship.

### 13\. Promote your WhatsApp channel on other platforms.

To maximize your reach on WhatsApp, it's vital to promote this channel on other platforms. Include a WhatsApp icon or link on your website, social media, marketing emails, and other relevant platforms.

This strategy not only informs your current and potential customers about your presence on WhatsApp but also facilitates their access to this communication channel. By directing traffic to WhatsApp, you increase sales opportunities and provide a direct and efficient channel for customer interaction.

### 14\. Use chatbots to increase your productivity.

And finally, the golden advice: use chatbots to increase your operation without having to spend a lot of money. Are you afraid of not being able to keep up with responding to messages or of not being able to implement these tips?

Well, the good news is that now is the perfect time for a chatbot. Put it to work for you 24/7 so that your prospects don't slip away and can reach you without any issues.

  <title>KYC regulations in Mexico: What are the current ones?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/kyc-mexico-0</url>
  <content>**_Compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations in Mexico plays a crucial role in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Let me tell you about the main regulations!_**

The importance of [complying with KYC](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc) regulations in Mexico lies in its ability to identify and verify the identity of customers, as well as to understand the nature and purpose of their financial transactions, acting as a barrier to prevent the misuse of financial services for illicit purposes.

Given its strategic geographical position and economic significance, it must ensure that its financial institutions adhere to the highest standards in KYC matters.

That's what I'll talk about in this article, how KYC contributes to greater stability and security in the Mexican financial system. In this post, you'll see:

*   What is KYC (Know Your Customer)?
*   What is its purpose within the financial system and for regulated entities?
*   The role of KYC in the fight against money laundering
*   Mexico's role in complying with FATF recommendations
*   Key laws and regulations governing KYC in Mexico
*   The 6 steps to verify the identity of individuals and corporations in Mexico
*   The main challenges of implementing KYC processes in Mexico
*   The opportunity you can't miss

What is KYC (Know Your Customer)?
---------------------------------

**Know Your Customer (KYC)**, is a vital process within the financial system that focuses on verifying the identity of customers and understanding the nature and purpose of their financial transactions. 

What is its purpose within the financial system and for regulated entities?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's look at the reasons why KYC is so important in Mexico. 

### **1 - Understanding customer activity and profile**

What is the nature and purpose of the customer's financial transactions? To know this, you must evaluate the customer's profile, their sources of income and the type of transactions they regularly make.

### **2 - Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing**

The main objective of KYC is to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by ensuring that financial institutions know their customers and understand the nature and purpose of their financial transactions.

### **3 - Regulatory compliance and legal requirements**

KYC is also a legal requirement in Mexico; there are specific regulations, such as the Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Operations with Illicitly Obtained Resources, which require financial institutions to implement rigorous KYC procedures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

### **4 - Building trust in the financial system**

KYC plays a crucial role in protecting consumers and the financial system as a whole, generating trust and facilitating mass adherence to resources that promote the financial health of all Mexicans.

The role of KYC in the fight against money laundering
-----------------------------------------------------

Money laundering poses a significant threat to the integrity of the global financial system, and KYC is a response that helps identify illicit activities. 

By collecting information about the identity and profile of customers, financial institutions can detect any unusual or suspicious activity that may indicate attempts at money laundering or other illicit financial activities.

Mexico's role in complying with FATF recommendations
----------------------------------------------------

Mexico plays an important role in complying with the recommendations of the [Financial Action Task Force (FATF)](https://www.gob.mx/uif/documentos/gafi) in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

FATF is an intergovernmental organization that sets international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and Mexico has been a member of this organization since 2000.

### **Commitment to regulatory compliance**

Mexico's commitment is reflected in its efforts to strengthen the supervision and control of financial institutions to ensure compliance with regulations against money laundering, working closely with FATF and other international organizations.

### **Importance of international cooperation**

Mexico demonstrates its [commitment by collaborating](https://blog.truora.com/es/la-importancia-de-las-alianzas-en-la-lucha-contra-el-fraude-online) with other jurisdictions and international organizations to share information and best practices in the prevention and detection of money laundering.

### **Adoption of regulatory measures**

Mexico has adopted a series of regulatory measures in line with FATF recommendations to strengthen its efforts against money laundering. Let's talk about that next!

Key laws and regulations governing KYC in Mexico
------------------------------------------------

In Mexico, compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) is supported by a comprehensive legal framework that includes several laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering and other illicit financial activities.

These regulations establish clear standards for financial institutions and other regulated entities, ensuring that they implement robust customer identification and verification processes.

### **Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Operations with Illicitly Obtained Resources**

One of the most important laws in the context of KYC in Mexico is the [Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Operations with Illicitly Obtained Resources](https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/Normatividad/Ley%20Federal%20para%20la%20Prevenci%C3%B3n%20e%20Identificaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Operaciones%20con%20Recursos%20de%20Procedencia%20Il%C3%ADcita.pdf), commonly known as the Anti-Money Laundering Law (AML Law).

This law establishes the requirements and procedures that financial institutions and other regulated entities must follow to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing, such as:

*   Implementing robust **KYC policies and procedures**, including:
    *   verification of customer identity. 
    *   Monitoring financial transactions.
    *   Reporting suspicious activities to competent authorities.

### **Fintech Law**

Another relevant regulation in the context of KYC in Mexico is the **Law to Regulate Financial Technology Institutions (**[Fintech Law](https://www.gob.mx/bancodelbienestar/es/articulos/ley-fintech-mayor-seguridad-para-usuarios-de-la-banca-digital?idiom=es)**)**. 

This law, enacted in 2018: 

*   Establishes a regulatory framework for financial technology companies operating in Mexico, including online lending platforms and digital payment services.
*   Includes provisions related to KYC, requiring financial technology companies to implement appropriate customer identification and verification processes.

### **Provisions issued by the CNBV**

In addition to federal laws, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) [issues specific provisions](https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/Paginas/NORMATIVIDAD.aspx) related to KYC that regulate the activities of financial institutions in Mexico.

These provisions establish detailed guidelines on how financial institutions must comply with KYC requirements, including the documentation necessary for customer identification and verification, procedures for transaction monitoring, and reporting of suspicious activities.

Some of them are

*   [Law to Regulate the Activities of Savings and Loan Cooperatives](https://catalogonacional.gob.mx/FichaRegulacionid?regulacionId=5786)
*   [Credit Union Law](https://catalogonacional.gob.mx/FichaRegulacionid?regulacionId=5614)
*   [Law for Transparency and Ordering of Financial Services](https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/Normatividad/Ley%20para%20la%20Transparencia%20y%20Ordenamiento%20de%20los%20Servicios%20Financieros.pdf)

By setting clear and mandatory standards for customer identification and verification, these regulations help ensure that financial institutions fulfill their due diligence responsibilities and contribute to maintaining the security and stability of the Mexican financial system.

The 6 steps to verify the identity of individuals and corporations in Mexico 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Mexico, KYC regulations impose rigorous identity verification of individuals and corporations wishing to access their services. Here are the specific steps you must follow to comply with Mexican regulations!

### **1\. Information gathering**

The first step in the identity verification process is to collect basic customer information:

*   Full name
*   Date of birth
*   Residential address
*   Official identification number (such as INE or passport)
*   [CURP](https://blog.truora.com/es/validar-curp). 

It is essential to obtain accurate and complete information to ensure effective verification.

### **2\. Document verification**

Once the information is collected, financial institutions must proceed to verify the identification documents provided by the customer. 

This may include examining a valid official identification, such as a voting credential or passport, as well as other documents supporting the provided information, such as proof of address.

### **3\. Information validation**

This may involve comparing the information provided with government databases or other reliable sources to confirm its accuracy. Additionally, financial institutions may use data analysis tools to detect possible inconsistencies or fraud.

### **4\. Use of advanced technologies (in case of remote verification)**

**eKYC (Conozca a su cliente electrónico)** is a tool that allows remote and digital verification of customer identity using electronic and digital means to collect and verify the necessary information.

### **5\. Biometrics**

Biometrics is another technology increasingly used in identity verification. 

This includes verifying fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition and other unique biometric characteristics to securely and reliably confirm the customer's identity.

### **6\. Compliance verification**

Confirmation that financial institutions and other regulated entities comply with all regulations and guidelines issued by the competent authorities.

The main challenges of implementing KYC processes in Mexico 
------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the importance of complying with KYC regulations in the financial sector, institutions face several challenges in implementing efficient processes:

*   **Regulatory complexity:** your company must stay up-to-date with changes in legislation and adapt its KYC processes.
*   **High operating costs:** implementing and maintaining efficient KYC, such as technology acquisition costs and expenses associated with hiring trained personnel in KYC.

*   **Customer experience:** it can create friction in the customer experience, especially if the procedures are complicated or require a large amount of documentation.

  <title>Identity Fraud in Documents: how to combat it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/identity-fraud</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_The growing problem of identity fraud in documents is a widespread concern due to its impact on the financial world, jeopardizing trust in companies. That's what I'll be talking about in this post!_**

The relevance of the KYC process is due to the fact that identity fraud in documents is one of the most common forms of cybercrime today, affecting many individuals and businesses of all sizes.

That's why today I'll talk about how to combat identity fraud in documents. In this post, you'll see:

*   What document fraud is
*   What are the main types
*   How technology and digitization have increased the risk and sophistication of fraud
*   What are the main prevention methods
*   Legislations in different countries
*   Protect yourself against document fraud

What is document fraud?
-----------------------

Document fraud is a crime that involves the manipulation, falsification or misuse of legal, financial or official documents for the purpose of obtaining illegal benefits or deceiving individuals or institutions.

It can encompass a wide range of documents—checks, identification cards, legal contracts, passports, property certificates and financial records—and have devastating consequences for victims, such as financial losses, reputational damage, legal issues and difficulties in recovering lost identity or assets.

What are the main types?
------------------------

Below, I'll explain in detail the different types of document fraud and their implications.

### **Forgery: Manipulation of genuine documents**

This refers to the creation or alteration of genuine documents with false or fraudulent information. This can involve:

1.  Creating completely fake documents, such as identifications or certificates.
2.  Tampering with existing documents to change their content or original purpose. This may include:
    1.  removing or adding information,
    2.  manipulating dates or numbers,
    3.  forging signatures. 

It can be done manually or using advanced technology, making it difficult to detect without appropriate security measures.

### Synthetic identities: Creation of fake profiles

A sophisticated form of document fraud involving the creation of fake profiles using partially true and partially false information that allows cybercriminals to open bank accounts, apply for credit or commit other financial crimes.

Synthetic identities are difficult to detect and trace, making them an increasing threat in the digital and financial world.

### Other types of document fraud

In addition to the types mentioned before, there are other forms of document fraud worth noting such as:

*   **Identity theft**, where criminals use other people's personal information to commit fraud in their name;
*   **Credit card fraud**, where stolen or counterfeit cards are used for unauthorized purchases;
*   **More specialized forms** of document fraud, such as forgery of investment documents or manipulation of legal documents in business transactions.

How technology and digitization have increased the risk and sophistication of fraud  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While technological advances have many benefits, they have also led to new forms of document fraud, which have become more sophisticated and difficult to detect.

Below, I'll discuss how technology and digitization have increased the risk and sophistication of fraud, presenting new challenges.

### New technologies

Some of the advanced technologies and tools that have contributed to this are:

*   **Image editing software:** allows modification of texts, removal or addition of elements, color adjustments and other manipulations that can make a falsified document look authentic.
*   **Advanced printing technologies:** high-resolution laser and inkjet printers can produce documents with visual quality very close to that of genuine documents.
*   **Optical character recognition (OCR) technologies:** scans printed documents and, converting them into editable text, can be used to counterfeit from scanned genuine documents.
*   **Cryptography:** criminals can forge digital certificates or authenticity seals to make counterfeit documents appear legitimate from an electronic standpoint.
*   **Artificial intelligence and machine learning:** they can be used to create more convincing and harder-to-detect fake documents.

### **Cybersecurity vulnerabilities**

Cyberattacks, such as phishing and malware, can compromise the security of computer systems and allow criminals to access sensitive documents.

On the other hand, the increasing interconnectedness of computer systems and the proliferation of Internet-connected devices increase the attack surface and demand more care with:

*   Secure storage of biometric data;
*   Misuse of personal information;
*   Ethical issues about control, transparency, mass surveillance, and algorithmic bias.

What are the main prevention methods?
-------------------------------------

Below, I'll show you some key methods that can help you combat document fraud, from document authentication to the use of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence.

### Know Your Customer (KYC): Identity Verification

The KYC process verifies the identity of your customers by collecting and verifying personal information such as identification documents, addresses and biometric data.

By implementing rigorous KYC procedures, you can reduce the risk of fraud by ensuring that customers are who they say they are and that the documents presented are authentic.

### Digital Identity Verification

Another crucial method for detecting and preventing document fraud in digital environments. This technique uses advanced tools and algorithms to verify the authenticity of electronic documents and the identity of users online.

This may include comparing facial images with identification documents, validating digital signatures and verifying the consistency of information provided by users.

It is especially useful in e-commerce and online banking environments, where accurate authentication is critical to preventing fraud.

### Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies

Artificial intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in detecting and preventing document fraud. 

AI algorithms can analyze large volumes of data and behavioral patterns to identify suspicious activities and anomalies in documents and transactions.

This may include detecting forged signatures, identifying altered documents and predicting fraudulent activities based on historical behavioral models.

### **Education and Awareness**

In addition to implementing technological measures, it is crucial to educate employees and the general public about security practices and warning signs of document fraud by:

1.  Training in identifying forged documents.
2.  Raising awareness about tactics used by criminals.
3.  Promoting security practices in handling confidential information.

Legislation in different countries
----------------------------------

In the battle against document fraud, laws and regulations play a crucial role in establishing standards and penalties to prevent and punish these criminal practices.

Below, I will discuss some relevant legislation and associated penalties in different countries.

### Legislation in the United States

In the United States, the fight against document fraud is supported by a series of federal and state laws.

The Federal Document Fraud and Abuse Act (18 USC § 1028) prohibits the production, possession or use of counterfeit documents, such as identification cards or passports.

Additionally, the Fraud and Abuse Protection Act (18 USC § 1029) establishes penalties for credit and debit card fraud. Violations of these laws can result in imprisonment, fines and restitution to fraud victims.

### Legislation in the European Union

In the European Union, the fight against document fraud is regulated by a series of directives and regulations that establish common standards throughout the region.

The Directive on Fraud and Counterfeiting Offenses [(Directive 2013/40/EU)](https://www.boe.es/doue/2019/123/L00018-00029.pdf) establishes penalties for document fraud, including the forgery of identification documents and passports.

Also, the General Data Protection Regulation [(RGPD)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/ES/legal-content/summary/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.html) sets strict rules for the handling and protection of personal data, helping prevent the misuse of information for fraudulent purposes.

### Legislation in Colombia

In Colombia, the legal framework related to digital document fraud includes:

[Law 1581 of 2012,](https://www.funcionpublica.gov.co/eva/gestornormativo/norma.php?i=49981) also known as the Personal Data Protection Law, which establishes the legal framework for the protection of individuals' privacy and regulates the processing of personal data by public and private entities in Colombia.

[Law 527 of 1999 (Electronic Commerce Law)](https://www.funcionpublica.gov.co/eva/gestornormativo/norma.php?i=4276#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPor%20medio%20de%20la%20cual,y%20se%20dictan%20otras%20disposiciones.%E2%80%9D): which establishes legal provisions to recognize the legal validity of data messages, digital signatures and electronic documents in Colombia. It also regulates aspects such as the authenticity and integrity of data messages.

### **Legislation in Mexico**

In Mexico, relevant laws for digital document fraud include:

*   [Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties](https://www.gob.mx/indesol/documentos/ley-federal-de-proteccion-de-datos-personales-en-posesion-de-los-particulares) (LFPDPPP), enacted in 2010, which aims to regulate the legitimate, controlled and informed treatment of personal data by private entities in Mexico.
*   [Advanced Electronic Signature Law:](https://www.gob.mx/wikiguias/articulos/ley-de-firma-electronica-avanzada-lfea?state=published) establishes provisions related to the legal validity and security of electronic signatures in Mexico.

  <title>Banking digitization: What is changing in the industry?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/banking-digitalization</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_Consumers are seeking financial solutions that adapt to their digitized lifestyle. In this post, I discuss banking digitization!_**

**Convenience is the key to banking digitization.** People want to lead an active financial life, and if we can say one thing about the digital world, it's that it promotes speed**.**

Users want speed—meaning promptness, swiftness and velocity—to access their bank accounts, transfer money, and pay bills from the comfort of their mobile devices or computers.

"Speed is the enemy of perfection," says the old adage, which is why security is also a concern. Providing fast, personalized, and quality service requires having the certainty of knowing [who you are doing business with](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc), and doing it just as quickly.

Today, I will talk about how crucial it is for banking institutions to continue innovating, updating, and adapting to the changing needs and expectations of consumers. In this post, you will see: 

*   How digitization is altering banking business models
*   Adapting to new technological demands in the banking sector
*   How digitization facilitates greater access to financial services
*   The challenges of digitization
*   Santander One Pay FX as an example of innovation
*   Incorporating clients swiftly and ensuring security

How digitization is altering banking business models
----------------------------------------------------

The banking sector has had to adapt and transform its business models to meet the changing demands of consumers.

**A prominent example of this transformation is Banco Santander**, which has led the way in adopting innovative technologies to enhance customer experience and optimize its operations.

### **Artificial Intelligence: Enhancing UX**

One of the key technologies that has driven Banco Santander's digital transformation is artificial intelligence (AI): 

*   **Developing advanced data analysis systems** that provide valuable insights into customer needs and preferences, allowing for more personalized services.
*   **Analyzing customer behavior** and offering personalized recommendations on financial products of interest, increasing cross-selling opportunities.

### **Virtual Assistants: Improving Operational Efficiency**

Another key technology adopted by Banco Santander is virtual assistants that use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to:

*   Interact with customers
*   Respond quickly and efficiently to their inquiries
*   Assist them with tasks such as balance inquiries, money transfers, and bill payments.

As consumers, we can expect to see more exciting advancements in the future as financial institutions continue to innovate and adapt to an increasingly digitized world.

Adapting to New Technological Demands in the Banking Sector
-----------------------------------------------------------

It is essential to examine changes in employment and the skills required to adapt to new technological demands.

### **Transformation of Employment in the Banking Sector**

Some traditional roles have evolved or disappeared, while others have emerged in response to new technological demands.

For example, ATMs and online banking systems have reduced the need for personnel in physical branches, leading to a decrease in roles such as in-person customer service and manual transaction processing. 

At the same time, as banks seek to leverage technology to the fullest extent, new employment opportunities have arisen in areas such as:

*   Data management;
*   Cybersecurity;
*   Software developmenta gestión de datos.

### **Skills Required in the Digitized Banking Sector**

While traditional skills such as financial knowledge and customer service remain important, technological and data analysis skills are now also highly valued, including:

*   The ability to **work with software and digital platforms**, essential in roles such as mobile app development, 
*   **Information system management** and the implementation of artificial intelligence solutions.
*   **Analytical skills and the ability to interpret large volumes of data** are increasingly in demand in areas such as risk analysis, [fraud detection](https://blog.truora.com/es/casos-emblematicos-de-fraudes-financieros) and personalized customer services.

### **Importance of Adapting to New Technological Demands**

Financial institutions also have a responsibility to train and retrain their staff to adapt to technological changes and develop the necessary skills to succeed in the digital environment and make the most of the opportunities offered by technology.

Adapting to new technological demands is crucial to ensuring the continued relevance and success of the banking sector in the digital age.

How Digitization Facilitates Greater Access to Financial Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the primary ways digitization has improved access to financial services is by eliminating the physical and temporal restrictions associated with traditional bank branches.

Now, a wide range of banking transactions can be conducted from the comfort of home or on the go, through mobile devices or computers, without delays or time wasted on commuting.

### **Expanding the Reach of Financial Inclusion**

Digitization has also allowed financial institutions to reach segments of the population traditionally underserved by conventional banking services.

Thanks to the accessibility and convenience of online services, unbanked or underbanked individuals can now open accounts, transfer money, pay bills and access a variety of other financial services without the need to visit a physical branch.

### **Openbank: An Example of Innovation in Digital Financial Services**

A prominent example of how digitization is improving financial inclusion is Openbank, an online bank that operates exclusively through digital channels and offers a wide range of financial services, including:

*   Checking accounts;
*   Savings accounts;
*   Credit cards;
*   Loans and insurance. 

To offer this service, they had to implement advanced security measures to protect financial information and ensure secure online transactions.

The Challenges of Digitization
------------------------------

As the banking sector enters an era of accelerated digitization, a series of challenges arise, including:

*   Cybersecurity; 
*   Data privacy;
*   [The need for robust regulations](https://blog.truora.com/es/legislacion-fintech) to protect consumers and safeguard the integrity of the financial system.

In this section, we will explore these challenges using Banco Santander as an example and examine how they handle data management.

### **Cybersecurity: Protecting Digital Assets**

With the increasing threat of cyberattacks, such as phishing, malware and data breaches, Banco Santander invested in advanced cybersecurity technologies to protect its digital infrastructure, including:

*   State-of-the-art firewalls;
*   Intrusion detection systems;
*   Security awareness training programs for employeesirewalls de última generación. 

Additionally, the bank conducts regular security audits and collaborates closely with cybersecurity agencies to identify and mitigate potential threats.

### **Data Privacy: Ensuring Client Information Confidentiality**

Data privacy is another critical aspect; banks handle vast amounts of information and protecting it from unauthorized access and misuse is essential to maintaining customer trust and complying with data privacy regulations.

Banco Santander follows strict protocols that include:

*   Data encryption in transit and at rest;
*   Implementation of granular access controls;
*   Compliance with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

Additionally, the bank works closely with regulatory authorities and data protection agencies to ensure ongoing compliance with privacy regulations.

### **Need for Regulations: Ensuring Security and Transparency**

The digitization of the banking sector demands clear standards of security and privacy, as well as transparency in business practices and data management.

Banco Santander collaborates with government regulators and participates in industry initiatives to develop and comply with rigorous compliance standards. 

Additionally, they work to educate customers about their rights and responsibilities regarding data security and privacy, promoting a culture of protection throughout the organization.

Santander One Pay FX: An Example of Innovation
----------------------------------------------

Santander One Pay FX is a clear example of how financial institutions are leveraging technology to enhance customer experience and simplify international financial transactions.

Santander introduced its innovative international transfer system, [backed by blockchain technology](https://blog.truora.com/es/fraudes-con-criptomonedas), in four nations.

*   Facilitates transfers to arrive at their destination on the same day on numerous occasions, or at the latest, the following day.
*   In addition to the speed of transfers, the ability to show the customer the exact amount the recipient will receive in their chosen currency before the transaction is completed is highlighted.

The use of technologies like blockchain has reduced processing times and eliminated intermediaries in international transactions, resulting in lower costs and greater efficiency for customers.

Incorporate customers swiftly and ensure security

That's why Truora provides cutting-edge technology for you to carry out the customer onboarding process with a lot of security and without friction in the experience. That's what I'll talk about today! In this post, you'll see:

*   WhatsApp for your company's digital onboarding
*   Harnessing the potential of WhatsApp with Truora
*   The 7 key steps to implement an effective digital onboarding process
*   Experience a simplified and secure digital onboarding

What is digital onboarding?
---------------------------

Digital onboarding is the process of user entry, incorporation and qualification through online technology. This involves activities such as account creation, digital identity verification, profiling, electronic signature and preference setting.

Its goal is to simplify the user experience, reduce friction and streamline access to a digital service or product. It also facilitates information collection and allows for personalized support during the onboarding process.

In summary, it leverages digital tools to turn the onboarding process into an opportunity to improve the experience.

Identity verification
---------------------

Identity verification cannot fail; it is the essential process that creates an environment of security and trust while contributing to agreement compliance.

### **Security and compliance**

Being certain of the user's identity [prevents fraud](https://blog.truora.com/es/casos-emblematicos-de-fraudes-financieros) and identity theft, creating a space for transactions to take place securely and reliably.

Additionally, it is a legal obligation to protect your customers' data, so it helps you comply with these regulations, avoiding fines and penalties.

### **Evolution of the buyer's needs**

tI's not just about meeting the necessary requirements; it's about understanding that buyers' needs and expectations go beyond that. They expect you to use the information you have about them responsibly and to their benefit.

Their evolution towards more personalized uses reflects the demand for tailored experiences by consumers, with companies now able to offer exceptional onboarding experiences directly on WhatsApp.

The market's transition towards portable digital identity solutions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The relevance of WhatsApp reflects a significant shift towards simple digital identity solutions and the growing consumer demand for control over their information and simplifying identity verification processes.

In this section, I will explain the transition period in the market towards these portable solutions and the challenges it faces in the identity verification process.

### Demand for portable digital identity

Every day, the number of online services and applications requiring identity verification increases, but this process can be cumbersome and impractical, often requiring providing the same personal information over and over again.

That's why portable digital identity solutions seek to address this problem by allowing users to control and share their identity information securely and conveniently across multiple platforms and online services.

### Challenges in identity verification

As mobile digital identity solutions gain popularity, they also face new challenges, especially regarding the security and authenticity of personal information.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deepfake technology have made it easier than ever to create false or altered identities that can go unnoticed in identity verification processes.

This poses a significant risk to companies and consumers, as it can lead to fraud and cyberattacks.

WhatsApp for your company's digital onboarding 
-----------------------------------------------

Now I'll talk about how your company can use WhatsApp to facilitate and streamline the user onboarding process, highlighting its benefits in terms of ease, efficiency, user experience improvement, and acquisition cost reduction.

### Ease and efficiency in digital onboarding

Its simple and familiar interface makes it easy for users to interact and complete the digital onboarding process quickly and seamlessly. Additionally, you can conveniently and efficiently send text messages, images and documents, along with the necessary information from your users.

### Enhanced user experience

Using WhatsApp for digital onboarding not only simplifies the process for users but also significantly enhances their experience.

By providing them with the option to complete the onboarding process through a platform they already use and are familiar with, you remove entry barriers and reduce friction, increasing the likelihood of users successfully completing the process.

### Reduction in acquisition costs

By leveraging a free and widely used messaging platform like WhatsApp, you eliminate the need to invest in expensive marketing or advertising campaigns to attract new users.

Instead, you can directly reach out to your customers and leads through a channel they already actively use, resulting in more cost-effective and efficient customer acquisition.

### Harnessing the potential of WhatsApp with Truora

Using WhatsApp for digital onboarding provides a range of significant benefits, and Truora is a company specialized in helping you maximize them

Offer your users a faster, more convenient and satisfactory digital onboarding experience.

The 7 key steps to implement an effective digital onboarding process
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, I'll tell you the key steps to carry out this implementation, based on market trends in identity verification.

### **1 - Define objectives and requirements**

The first step is to clearly define the objectives of the process and the requirements necessary to achieve them.

This includes:

*   Identifying the stages of the onboarding process
*   Defining he information you want to collect from your customers during the process.
*   Identifying the security and compliance standards that must be met

### **2 - Select an identity verification platform**

Once the objectives and requirements have been established, it's important to select the identity verification platform. Truora offers the most advanced solutions so you can easily integrate them into your company's digital onboarding process.

### **3 - Design an intuitive interface**

The interface of the digital onboarding process plays a crucial role in the user experience.

Truora's interface is intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to guide your users through the process step by step and enable them to complete identity verification quickly and seamlessly.

### **4 - Personalize the verification process**

It's essential to personalize the identity verification process to suit individual needs and preferences. Truora offers options that allow you to design the process according to specific requirements.

For example, in [financial sectors](https://www.truora.com/es/industria-financiera) where security is critical, it may be necessary to implement additional verification steps, such as scanning additional documents or biometric verification, to ensure user authenticity.

On the other hand, in [e-commerce](https://www.truora.com/es/industria-marketplaces), a more streamlined verification process may be preferable to not hinder the user experience.

You can also address specific privacy and security concerns by allowing users to choose from different verification methods or adjust the level of information they want to share.

### **5 - Ensure security and compliance**

Security and compliance are critical aspects of the digital onboarding process. Truora ensures this with robust security measures to protect your users' personal information and comply with current privacy and data protection regulations.

### **6 - Continuously test and optimize**

Once you have implemented the digital onboarding process, it's important to conduct comprehensive testing to identify potential issues or areas for improvement. Continuously optimizing the process based on user feedback and identity verification market trends is essential.

### **7 - Adapt to changes**

Last but not least, it's crucial to adapt the digital onboarding process to the changing needs and preferences of users.

This may involve incorporating new technologies and functionalities, as well as regularly updating the interface and process flow to ensure an optimal user experience.

  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/client-acquisition-channels</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_Omnichannel is the trend, but  among all the paths you must choose one to lead your customers. That path is WhatsApp, a powerfull ally for your company's customer acquisition channels. In this post, I'll talk to you about that!_**

[WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp), is much more than a simple communication tool; its integration of secure verification processes has revolutionized the way your company can communicate with its customers, ensuring that only authenticated users have access to the services and products you offer.

Combined with its personalized interaction through segmented messages, automatic responses, and its practicality in seamlessly integrating into people's daily lives, it makes it an unparalleled customer acquisition channel.

The 3 main advantages of WhatsApp as a customer acquisition channel:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Security**

WhatsApp has always stood out for its robust end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can access the message content and are protected against possible cyber attacks, guaranteeing user privacy.  

*   But the main news is that it is also possible to integrate it with high-precision digital validators to create a reliable customer base built with authentic data from acquisition.

This ensures data security for your company and builds trust with your customers by ensuring the confidentiality of interactions.

### Hyper-personalized Interactions:

Personalization is key to creating memorable customer experiences and, additionally, to acquire customers.

[WhatsApp, in it's business version,](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api) offers a range of tools that allow you to personalize interactions with your cutomers on another level.

From segmented messages to automatic responses based on specific criteria, you can tailor your communication to meet the individual needs of each customer and guide your leads through the sales funnel at every stage of the buying journey.

### **Practicality**

WhatsApp's widespread use and familiarity make it an unparalleled customer acquisition channel. With over a billion users worldwide, it provides a unique opportunity to engage with your leads in an environment they already know, use, and trust. 

Its responsiveness on mobile devices and computers means interactions can occur anytime, anywhere, adding an additional level of convenience for both businesses and customers.

The 5 Channels Where You Should Have a WhatsApp Button
------------------------------------------------------

Now we'll talk about other, also very popular, channels that are an essential part of a good client acquisition strategy. The interesting part is that in all of them you can add bottons that lead directly to WhatsApp. 

### **1) Social Media for Engagement and Branding**

While everything changes very quickly in the digital world, social networks continue to be an essential channel in 2024, to connect with customers and strengthen the online presence of your brand.

Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn offer unique opportunities to interact with your audience, build solid relationships and increase brand awareness.

The key to success on social networks lies in:

*   Creating relevant and engaging content that tunes in with the interests and needs of your target audience.
*   Using tools such as paid ads and sponsored posts to expand the reach and increase the effectiveness of your company's social media strategy.

In both cases, you can place a Click to WhatsApp button!

### **2) Email marketing for personalization and reach**

While speed has changed, the classic email remains a fundamental tool in a professional's marketing mix. Through it, you can offer personalized and relevant content directly to the inbox of your leads and customers.

Smart segmentation of an email list, combined with the use of automation, allows you to send highly specific and timely messages that resonate with each segment of your audience.

Highly scalable and cost-effective, although more efficient in the middle and bottom of the funnel, it continues to have a great influence on acquiring customers and leading them to WhatsApp, making it an attractive option for businesses of all sizes in 2024.

### **3) SEO and content marketing for long-term visibility**

SEO (_Search Engine Optimization_) and content marketing are fundamental pillars for increasing online visibility in the long term.

By creating relevant, valuable and search engine-optimized content, your company can position itself as a leader in its industry and attract high-quality organic traffic to its website.

SEO and content marketing strategies include:

*   Keyword research.
*   Optimization of existing content.
*   Creation of new content. 
*   Link building. 

While this strategy may take a few months to work, once this time has passed, you begin to see the benefits of having more visibility in search results and greater online authority.

A blog that is a reference in your area of action and becomes a place of consultation is an excellent gateway to acquiring new customers and starting a conversation on WhatsApp.

### **4) Online advertising for quick reach and segmentation**

Online advertising offers a quick and effective way to reach a specific audience and increase brand awareness.

Platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads and Twitter Ads allow you to create highly targeted ads that target users based on their location, interests, browsing behavior and more.

There is a wide variety of ad formats, including text, images, videos and interactive ads, giving you the ability to effectively engage your audience to initiate direct conversations.

### **5) Influencers and marketing**

Influencer marketing and affiliate marketing are powerful strategies to increase brand credibility and reach.

By partnering with relevant influencers in your industry, you can reach highly engaged audiences and leverage the trust that these personalities have established with their followers.

On the other hand, affiliate marketing allows you to expand your reach with partners who promote your products or services in exchange for a commission for each sale generated.

WhatsApp makes their job easier by giving them a clear and direct channel to drive the volume of leads they send to you.

Everything leads to WhatsApp, learn the best practices
------------------------------------------------------

And finally, since we were able to demonstrate to you why WhatsApp is the best acquisition channel and how it works in an omnichannel strategy through Click to WhatsApp, what is missing is for you to learn best practices so that you are never penalized on this platform.

### **Adequacy**

Never be inappropriate, take care of the tone of voice, the information you transmit and remember that there are some types of services that are prohibited on WhatsApp.

### **Consent**

Before sending messages through WhatsApp, it is essential to obtain the consent of users.

This can be done explicitly at the time of collecting contact information, or through a subscription request on your website or social networks. Respect your customers' privacy preferences and allow them to have control over the frequency and type of messages they wish to receive.

### **Reasonable Frequency**

Avoid flooding your customers with messages, establish a reasonable balance and send messages selectively and timely. Ensure that every message you send is relevant, useful and that it adds value to your customers.

Additionally, consider the frequency of messages and avoid sending them at inappropriate times, such as during the night or working hours.

### Offer Subscription and Cancellation Options

Provide your customers with the option to subscribe to or unsubscribe from receiving WhatsApp messages at any time.

Provide clear instructions on how they can do this and ensure that the process is simple and straightforward. Respecting your customers' privacy and preferences will strengthen their trust in your brand and foster a positive long-term relationship.

### Be Responsive and Respectful

Establish bidirectional communication with your customers and encourage interaction. Respond promptly to their inquiries, complaints or comments, and demonstrate your commitment to their satisfaction.

Actively listen to their needs and concerns, and adapt your strategies accordingly. Additionally, be respectful of their time and space, avoiding sending intrusive or irrelevant messages.

  <title>More Effective Collection Channels: 10 Keys to Integrating Them</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/collection-channels</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_2024 has begun, businesses are continuing, and having an effective collection channel policy is the major challenge of this year. With all the conveniences of the digital economy and the advancements of fintechs, knowing how to collect is a new service you offer to your customers, helping them organize their finances. That's what I discuss in this article!_**

Technology has transformed the way your company can interact with clients with past-due payments., turning what used to be an uncomfortable moment into an opportunity to improve your customers' experience and build loyalty.

While speed and personalization are key, they cannot jeopardize your stability or cash flow so that you can remain competitive and ensure payment of what is owed.

Continuing with the logic that helping your customers organize their financial health can be a business opportunity, this is where WhatsApp comes in, the most effective tool to turn that uncomfortable moment into a pleasant and prosperous conversation for both parties.

The secret is to have the ability to integrate and coordinate these different channels to ensure your customers receive proper guidance and, at the same time, a consistent, memorable, and frictionless experience.

That's what I'll talk about today, how to integrate the most effective collection channels and use WhatsApp to turn headaches into business opportunities. In this article, you'll see:

*   What are the most effective collection channels
*   Omnichannel: the complete and effective strategy
*   The 9 keys to an omnichannel collection strategy
*   Truora, the best way to integrate

What are the most effective collection channels?
------------------------------------------------

While the centrality of WhatsApp is undeniable, it´s essential that you know all the collection channels in order to be able to generate omnichannelity and lead your users to an efficient conversation, no matter which platform they communicate from.

Let's get straight to the point!

### Banking apps: good but insufficient

Banking apps provide specific responses 24/7, which is a good solution to address customers' financial needs anytime, anywhere.

They also allow your customers to access detailed information about their accounts, outstanding balances, and payment options, providing specific answers to their queries and enabling them to make informed financial decisions.

But they don't have the ability to be part of your customers' lives, they are a good accessory channel but they are insufficient.

### Emails: excellent if the user is not in a hurry

Emails can be used to send personalized messages addressing specific concerns of customers in default, providing tailored solutions to their individual needs.

Although an email can also be sent or received at any time, that doesn't mean we can consider it 24/7 attention. Therefore, it is a somewhat slow channel for this time, it can be good for follow-up, but its Achilles' heel is that they are not instantaneous.

### Social networks: a battlefield for your customers' attention

Social networks are experiencing increasing use for more accessible interactions with debtors, providing an additional channel for you to communicate effectively and build a strong relationship.

Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are very popular and allow fast and direct bidirectional communication, facilitating contact with debtors and efficient problem-solving.

Direct messages, comments, and posts on social networks can be used to provide information about outstanding payments, offer payment options, and respond to queries quickly and personally.

But don't forget something fundamental, **social networks scatter your** [customers' attention,](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente) what you gain in reach you lose in focus, a customer who may be thinking of paying off their debt may be captured by an interaction that leads them to another expense.

In other words, on social networks, you'll be entering a place of battle for your user's attention, which makes them an unfavorable ground for your goal.

### SMS: reduced cost but somewhat invasive

SMS remains an essential tool in any collection strategy due to its low cost and high effectiveness in communication.

It offers a quick and direct way to contact your debtors, as messages are delivered instantly to their mobile devices. This allows you to send payment reminders, overdue bill notifications, and payment options in a timely and efficient manner.

At the same time, its open rate is high and, compared to other communication channels, it has a higher likelihood of being read by recipients.

But let's be honest, SMS no longer has the prestige it once had and causes a lot of insecurity. It is not a channel we are familiar with and it always has some invasiveness that can generate distrust.

### WhatsApp: the tool for immediacy and personalization

And to finish this list, we leave the best for last, WhatsApp stands out from all others for being integrated into people's lives in a natural way. The familiarity people have with this application is its main value.

Not to mention its immediacy and ability to personalize interactions through chatbots, becoming an invaluable tool for modern collection strategies.

The WhatsApp Business API version allows you to take this to another level, integrating chatbots with Artificial Intelligence that can instantly respond to frequently asked questions, provide relevant information about outstanding payments, deadlines, and payment options, and, most interestingly, develop conversations that simulate [human interaction](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-transferir-tus-conversaciones-de-un-chatbot-de-whatsapp-a-un-humano-con-hubspot).

If what you need is a quick and personalized response for your debtors, WhatsApp is the ideal solution to make debt resolution a pleasant experience. 

Omnichannel: the complete and effective strategy
------------------------------------------------

Now, to wrap up our discussion on effective collection channels, let's consider the power of a unified approach. In today's digital landscape, leveraging synergies across all channels is crucial for maximizing impact.

Omnichannelity involves integrating all these channels into your collection strategy to make it a comprehensive and effective experience. By offering multiple points of contact, you can communicate, guide, nurture the relationship, and maintain focus on the issue.

Obviously, for this to be possible, it is necessary to use a robust state-of-the-art technological integration system. Let's talk about that next!

The 9 keys to an omnichannel collection strategy
------------------------------------------------

All roads lead to WhatsApp, where you can provide a unique type of attention that will generate a different connection with your users.

But for everything to work perfectly and avoid frictions in the experience or gaps in security, it will be necessary to take into account the points we will detail below.

### 1\. Integrate communication channels

  <title>Artificial intelligence in debt collection: 5 approaches to apply it</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/artificial-intelligence-in-collections</url>
  <content>**_Artificial Intelligence (AI), a powerful tool that has transformed all facets of business life, and debt collection is no exception.._** 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to learn from data and perform tasks by mimicking human reasoning autonomously. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the global economy, challenging companies to rethink their debt collection strategies. It was in this context that AI emerged as a lifesaver, offering innovative solutions to tackle these challenges. 

**Thanks to AI, your company can:**

*   Segment and better understand its delinquent customers, identifying behavioral patterns and anticipating the individual needs of each debtor. This is called **predictive capability.**
*   Automate routine tasks in the debt collection process, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex cases and relationship building. **This improves both customer and employee experience.**
*   And on top of all this, you can offer them the convenience of using [WhatsApp](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) as the channel through which they can manage their debt repayment journey.

That's what I'll talk about today: how companies that adopt these emerging technologies will be better positioned to face future challenges and stand out in an increasingly competitive market.

En este post verás:

1.  Personalizing the debtor experience
2.  Predictive capability
3.  How AI facilitates omnichannel communication
4.  Improving the Debtor Experience
5.  Optimizing Call Center Work with AI

1 - Personalizing the Debtor Experience
---------------------------------------

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in debt collection redefines the debtor experience, becoming an ally in efficiently recovering debts without creating friction in the [customer experience](https://blog.truora.com/es/chatbot-para-whatsapp-atencion-al-cliente).

**Is it possible for something as unpleasant as debt collection to be good for the customer experience? Yes, it is possible!**

AI allows your company to analyze vast amounts of data related to delinquent customers, identifying behavioral patterns and individual preferences. 

This means your company can tailor its debt collection strategy precisely and personally, creating a friendly and less intrusive interaction: 

*   **Instead of demanding payment, offer specific solutions tailored to each client's financial situation and needs.**

By feeling understood and attended to individually, debtors are more likely to cooperate and commit to a payment plan, reducing the risk of prolonged delinquency.

2 - Predictive Capability
-------------------------

Machine learning algorithms represent a revolution in debt collection management by allowing precise segmentation and effective prediction of payment behaviors. 

By analyzing large sets of historical and real-time data, they provide a deeper understanding of the financial situation of delinquent customers and perceive subtle signals indicating the likelihood of payment at any given time.

**For example:**

*   Customers with a high probability of payment may receive refinancing offers or flexible payment plans; 
*   Those with a low probability may require a more proactive and persuasive approach.

By leveraging these advanced analytical tools, your company can significantly improve its ability to recover debts and maintain a strong financial position

3 - How AI Facilitates Omnichannel Communication
------------------------------------------------

Effective communication is essential in the debt collection process, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized this aspect by allowing smoother, personalized, and omnichannel interaction.

### Analysis of preferences and behaviors

AI can identify the communication channels preferred by each customer and determine which methods are most effective for reaching each individual. 

This is achieved through the analysis of behavioral patterns and historical communication preferences.

### Personalization of messages and offers

Once the preferred channels are identified — **where WhatsApp leads as the best of all** — it allows [messages and offers to be personalized](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-enviar-mensajes-automatizados-por-whatsapp-desde-hubspot) y las ofertas for each client.

By using machine learning algorithms, your company can adapt the tone, content, and frequency of communications according to individual preferences. 

**For example:**

*   A customer who prefers brief and direct communication may receive concise text messages.
*   Another who prefers a more detailed approach may receive more comprehensive emails.

### Automation of interactions

[AI-driven chatbots](https://blog.truora.com/es/como-transferir-tus-conversaciones-de-un-chatbot-de-whatsapp-a-un-humano-con-hubspot) can interact in real-time, answer common questions, and provide relevant information about their accounts. 

This streamlines the communication process and frees up human resources to focus on more complex cases and relationship-building.

### Improving response rates and engagement

Customers are more likely to interact and respond to messages delivered through their preferred channels, increasing the effectiveness of debt collection strategies. 

Additionally, the customization of messages and offers increases relevance and perceived value, which also contributes to higher engagement.

4 - Improving the Debtor Experience
-----------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in an individual-focused debt management process and is essential for creating a positive experience for both the debtor and the company. 

### Deep understanding of the customer

By analyzing demographic data, purchasing behaviors, and other variables, your company can better segment and understand its customers' needs, preferences, and financial situations. 

This, in turn, provides a more comprehensive understanding of your customers and more precise and empathetic debt management.

### Sensitive and personalized communication

Instead of using a generic and invasive approach, your company can adapt its debt collection messages and actions to fit individual circumstances. 

**For example:**

*   Instead of sending automated payment reminders, your company can directly discuss customized payment options that suit their financial situation.

### Tailored offers and solutions

By analyzing financial and behavioral data, AI can identify the best refinancing options, flexible payment plans, or other solutions to effectively and sustainably resolve delinquency. 

### Reducing the sense of intrusion

An individual-focused management approach also helps reduce the feeling of intrusion often experienced by delinquent customers. 

Instead of feeling harassed or pressured by the company's debt collection actions, they perceive that the company is genuinely interested in helping them resolve their financial situation in a friendly and collaborative manner. 

This improves the perception of the company and increases the willingness to cooperate and commit to a payment plan.

### Building a relationship of trust

By demonstrating empathy, understanding, and willingness to adapt to the customer's needs, the company builds a solid and lasting relationship that goes beyond the financial transaction, benefiting in terms of debt recovery.

5 - Optimizing Call Center Work with AI
---------------------------------------

The implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the debt collection process not only improves operational efficiency but also allows call center advisors to focus on more complex cases, while routine tasks are effectively automated.

### Automation of routine tasks

Activities such as sending payment reminders, checking outstanding balances, or updating customer information can be performed automatically by intelligent systems, reducing the administrative workload on human staff.

### Focus on complex cases

With routine tasks handled by automated systems, call center advisors can dedicate more time and attention to situations requiring special negotiations, handling objections, or providing individualized financial advice. 

By allowing advisors to focus on complex cases, AI improves the quality of customer service and increases debt recovery chances.

### Analysis of payment behavior

AI also plays a crucial role in analyzing the payment behavior of delinquent customers. 

Using machine learning algorithms, AI can examine historical payment patterns, spending trends, and other relevant variables to predict the customer's future behavior. 

This predictive capability allows your company to anticipate customer needs and preferences, offering customized payment options or refinancing solutions tailored to their specific financial situation.

### Personalized payment offers

Based on payment behavior analysis, AI can recommend personalized payment or refinancing options for each delinquent customer.

**For example:**

*   A customer who has consistently shown late payment tendencies may receive a debt consolidation offer with lower monthly payments.
*   One facing temporary financial difficulties may benefit from a flexible payment plan tailored to their current payment capacity.

### Improving the debtor experience

Instead of feeling overwhelmed by generic payment demands, delinquent customers perceive that the company is willing to collaborate and find solutions tailored to their unique financial situation. This improves the customer's willingness to cooperate and resolve their debt.

As you can see, Artificial Intelligence has come to help us turn uncomfortable moments into opportunities. 

**And if we add** [**WhatsApp**](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api) **and Truora to that, we get the recipe for success.**

  <content>Is WhatsApp safe? All you need to know about the app security
-------------------------------------------------------------

4 min read

• July 13, 2022

*   [Intro](#top)

**_“Privacy and Security is in our DNA”_**

This is the quote with which WhatsApp starts its Security section on its website; On this [site](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/), the characteristics of personal and business messages and payments are specified, all with the aim of understanding how secure WhatsApp is.

If you still do not recognize the magnitude and importance of this instant messaging application, surely these figures will convince you. The figures show not only stats that make you trust the app's security, but also to start rethinking your marketing strategies with the aim of using them, for the benefit and growth of your company. 

According to data presented in the latest report by Hootsuite and We Are Social:

*   Currently, WhatsApp has more than 2,000 million users and it is expected that by 2027, it will exceed 3,000 million.
*   Since January 2021, the instant messaging application has grown by 4% in its number of daily users.
*   The app was downloaded in the last quarter of 2021, a total of 4.5 million times.
*   Compared to Facebook Messenger and WeChat, WhatsApp has 700 million more monthly users.
*   Through this app, more than 100,000 million messages are sent every day. 

We are ready! You already know the importance of WhatsApp and now we are going to explain everything about how safe it is.

In order to answer your question about how secure WhatsApp is, this application has divided its security website into three main sections, these are: 

*   Personal messages
*   Send messages to business
*   Payments

### **Personal messages**

If your doubts are based on asking yourself if WhatsApp is safe and private, the short answer is yes. This instant messaging application has end-to-end encryption, as long as the message is sent between personal accounts.

### **Send messages to business**

WhatsApp Business is a free download app that was created with the aim that small and medium-sized businesses could contact their customers directly and effectively. This version of the app that also allows you to organize, automate and respond to messages more quickly, has the same encryption protocol that protects the messages that are sent between personal accounts. 

It should be noted that when a text, image or other is sent to a business account, it is delivered safely. However, the privacy protocols used by said company with the messages it receives are not the responsibility of the application.

### **Payments**

this function, which is available only in selected countries, allows users to make transfers and payments between accounts of financial institutions. The security of this service lies in the fact that the card and bank account numbers are stored encrypted in a network with a high level of security.

It is important that you know that the payments aren’t end-to-end encrypted because the financial institutions need to receive the information of the transactions that are carried out.

**What is the end-to-end encrypted system?**
--------------------------------------------

Your doubts about whether WhatsApp is secure, has a very clear answer, yes, this is thanks to the fact that having end-to-end encryption as security prevents third parties from having access to the data that is sent from one device to another.

End-to-end encryption works in a very simple way. The data to be sent is encrypted on the sender's device and only the recipient can decrypt it.

Can you get hacked through WhatsApp?
------------------------------------

Being an instant messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption, the answer to this question is no. It is not possible to hack WhatsApp messages, since these, being encrypted, cannot be read or manipulated while they reach the recipient.

However, it is important to remember that the conversations are stored on the device and backed up on the server, which means that if you lose your phone, whoever finds it will be able to access your messages.

If after learning from this article that WhatsApp is safe, you want to start building personalized chats in this app for your company, at Truora we have the perfect solution for you to do so and boost the growth of your company with Truconnect. With Truconnect you can: 

*   Verify the identity of users.
*   Improve your conversion rates.
*   Reduce your response times. 

What are you waiting for? WhatsApp is secure and is the perfect way to automate your conversation flows according to the needs of your company, and without the need to use code.

  <title>Debt collection messages for WhatsApp: learn the best ones</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/debt-collection-messages</url>
  <content>A clear challenge in portfolio management is requesting payment in a friendly manner through collection messages, thereby encouraging customers to ultimately fulfill their financial obligations to the company.

This pressure, uncomfortable yet necessary for any business, can entail complex communication for both the sender and the recipient.

However, it's possible to ease this interaction, making it smoother without sacrificing solidity. Of course, this requires choosing the right words, the most favorable medium, and the opportune moment. In the following paragraphs, I'll show you how the right message, delivered through a high-reach channel like WhatsApp, can spare you the hassle of collection and improve the outcomes of your collection strategy.

But before delving into details, let's explore how segmentation sets the perfect stage for ensuring the effectiveness of any notification.

Divide your portfolio and prioritize accounts receivable.
---------------------------------------------------------

To strategically collect payments, we need tactics, and one of the most foolproof is segmentation. This process involves breaking down the debtor base into smaller groups based on different criteria to drive payment under similar characteristics.

4 key attributes for segmentation:

1.  Debt amount
2.  Debt age
3.  Debtor type
4.  Product or service 

Advantages of segmentation:

*   Optimizing time and focusing team efforts;
*   Scaling or prioritizing urgent cases;
*   Better understanding of each customer during collection;
*   Offering tailored solutions that meet the debtor's needs.

Why WhatsApp?
-------------

It's the most widely used instant messaging platform in Latin America, with proven effectiveness: 80% of messages are opened within the first five minutes of being sent.

In other words, this channel ensures contactability, one of the main indicators - and at the same time obstacles - encountered by collection departments.

From segmentation to the personalization of messages
----------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, profiling the portfolio and contacting the client through the appropriate medium allows a more personalized approach in the communications with the debtor. Understanding the client's financial status and using a familiar channel will build trust, increase cooperation, and open the doors to a successful reconciliation.

The most effective debt collection messages to persuade and obtain payment via WhatsApp

Break down payment barriers, depending on the case presented. Pay attention to these examples and draft your messages to address objections.

  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Before giving you options to answer your questions about how to reach new customers using WhatsApp, it is important to understand that today the importance of creating marketing strategies through this channel is due to important factors such as the number of users and the savings in time and money.

Below, we will explain you much more about this topic that will be of your total interest:

**Why use WhatsApp for your business?**
---------------------------------------

These are some of the facts that will give you a broader scenario on why you should use WhatsApp for your business:

In addition to these statistics that show the number of users of this app, it is important to recognize that there are other facts that add prominence to this strategy in your marketing plan.

According to data from the web portal Statista, more than half of WhatsApp users check their messages daily.

Forbes magazine has been emphatic in stating that the opening rate of messages sent by WhatsApp is 98%, which means that out of every 100 messages received, 98% are opened.

Another important reason is that 53% of users say that they would buy more easily from companies that can communicate through this chat.

In the same line of thought, we will now tell you about the benefits of Whatsapp marketing:

**4 Benefits of using WhatsApp for your business**
--------------------------------------------------

_Via Giphy_

### **1\. Creates a deeper relationship with your customers**

This deep relationship is built both ways, on the website of Meta, the company that controls Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, it is presented that in a survey conducted by them where they were seeking to understand what people felt when sending a message to a company, it was found that 66% of respondents said they had more confidence in the brand, while 55% said they had a better personal connection from the messages.

These data reinforce that by using WhatsApp in your marketing strategy, the relationship with your current and potential customers will improve, as they see in this channel a more reliable way to communicate with you.

### **2\. Improves your Conversion Rate**

Improving the conversion rate is without a doubt the most frequent and the most concerning objective of all companies. But in order to perceive improvements, you have to make new strategies that perhaps your competitors have not yet explored.

In this last argument, is where using WhatsApp, becomes essential to make a difference in the conversion rate, since according to data, companies admit that using this application 40% of their customers or prospects respond to their messages.

###  **3. Helps you sell more**

When we talk about selling more, we can say that your goal will be easier to achieve by using WhatsApp in your marketing strategies.

Increasing your sales through this platform will be easier since your customer service will improve and therefore, your customers or prospects will feel more appreciated and valued by your company; these are some figures that support this:

*   59% of people say that response times are better by this channel than by more traditional ones.
*   50% of those surveyed per goal say they receive better advice and attention through messaging.
*   Forty-nine percent of people say they prefer this media because the responses are more accurate.
*   Compared to traditional media, more than 58% of the people surveyed by Meta said they prefer to contact companies by message rather than by telephone, while 55% said they prefer this option over sending emails.

### **  
4\. Reduce your marketing costs**

The reason for this benefit is simple: the investment you will have if you start using WhatsApp in your marketing strategy will be less than the amount of money you have lost in your traditional strategies.

Remember that when you prefer WhatsApp, you are ensuring a higher open rate, a better response from your customers and therefore, a better conversion.

**WhatsApp Marketing Strategy: How to start?**
-------------------------------------------------

_Via Giphy_

  
How to start your WhatsApp marketing strategy? This is perhaps the most overwhelming point for brands and many think it is something complicated and tedious, but starting is the first and most important step you should take for your company, here we give you a guide that will help you greatly:

### **Establish your o****bjectives and KPIs**

Everything must be measured! And your WhatsApp marketing strategy is no exception. The first thing you should do is establish the objectives and KPIs you want to achieve.

For this step, we recommend you to identify your current shortcomings and how you think they will improve by using this application. Likewise, study your marketing and sales funnel and find those weak points in which you fail with conventional strategies.

With these points in mind, it will be easier to clarify whether you are going to measure conversion, retention, response times or any other data that interests you to reach your goal.

### **Define your target audience/buyer's persona**

At this point most people fail, when you are going to create your WhatsApp bulk marketing strategy it is crucial that you establish from the beginning to whom your efforts will be directed.

Do not forget that according to who your buyer persona is, their consumption habits change; do not fall into the common mistake of shooting to all audiences everything you have, because you will surely fail and lose time and money.

Build specific WhatsApp marketing strategies according to the audience you want to reach in order to obtain better outcomes.

### **Build your contact list**

Segmentation is your best decision! When we talk about WhatsApp marketing, creating lists is a step that you must take. In order to have these contacts, the best thing you can do is to put forms on your social networks or website. This way, you can segment and choose the buyer persona you want to reach with your plan.

### **Design your message/approach**

At this point you must remember that not all your buyer personas are interested in the same thing and therefore, you will have to create personalized messages and approaches for each segment. This way you can ensure that you are truly capturing the attention of users with information that is valuable to them.

### **Establish an awesome customer service**

If you are going to start your marketing strategy by WhatApp you must guarantee that the response times and the quality of the responses are the best. Do not forget that this form of contact is for some people a little more personal than traditional ones, therefore, you must make the most of the trust they have given you in order to give them value.

Although people prefer companies that have this form of communication, if you have bad customer service via WhatsApp, all your efforts will be wasted.

*   [Intro](#top)

Digital innovation is a critical part of business growth and success. It has the  
power to transform industries, change the way we live, and even change the  
way we think.

Digital innovation is the process of using technology to create new products, services, or processes. It involves finding new ways to use digital tools and platforms, and applying them to create innovative solutions.

[**Artificial Intelligence: How is Truora embracing AI?**](https://blog.truora.com/en/artificial-intelligence-how-can-latin-america-draw-inspiration-from-china-how-is-truora-embracing-ai)  **Read this other post!**

Why is digital innovation so important for business?
----------------------------------------------------

Digital innovation can help businesses solve problems and create new products. It can also help them reduce costs, increase sales, and improve customer service.

###  **Digital innovation strategy: What should I consider?**

_Via Giphy_

When planning your strategy, it is important to consider a few key factors:

1.   **Your business goals**: What do you want to achieve through digital innovation? This includes things like increasing efficiency or market share, increasing customer satisfaction, or opening up new opportunities for growth.
2.  **Your company's current state**: Do you already have some pieces of technology in place that could be used for digital innovation purposes? If so, what benefits could they provide? Are there any areas where you need to update or upgrade your infrastructure in order to make the strategy work?
3.  **The competition**: What are some of the latest trends in digital innovation? How are other businesses using technology to improve their operations? How can you stay ahead of the curve and position your company as a leader in this field?
4.  **The market demand**: Are there certain areas of your business where is more likely to have a widespread adoption of digital innovation? For example, could you use technology to improve customer service or marketing efforts? If so, what kind of solutions are currently being offered on the market? How your company does compare in terms of price/quality ratio and features offered?

**Digital innovation vs. digital transformation**
-------------------------------------------------

There is a lot of confusion surrounding the terms 'digital innovation' and digital transformation'. Here's a quick rundown on the key differences:

1.  Digital innovation is focused on using new technology to improve or change an existing process or business model.
2.  Digital transformation is a much broader term that refers to any effort undertaken to overhaul an organization's entire digital infrastructure, from data management to customer experience.

While both terms have their benefits, it's important to choose the right one for your company if you want to reap the most rewards. By understanding the differences between digital innovation and digital transformation, you can make better decisions about which tactics will work best for your business.

There's no single answer to this question, as the best approach depends on your company and the specific needs you're trying to address. However, there are a few key things to keep in mind when creating your strategy:

1.  Understand your customers. What do they want? What do they need?
2.  Analyze your current processes and systems. How can they be improved or replaced?
3.  Consider new technology options. What new tools and technologies could help you achieve your goals?
4.  Think outside the box. What opportunities exist to improve your business using nontraditional methods?
5.  Communicate with stakeholders regularly and openly to ensure everyone is on the same page.

  <title>The importance of customer onboarding in banking [Guide]</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/customer-onboarding-banking</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

As a bank, you know that new customers are essential to your success. But attracting and keeping those customers can be difficult – especially if they don’t have the best starting point.

That’s where customer onboarding comes into play. It’s a process that helps new customers get started and feel comfortable with your bank – from signing up for an account, or making transactions, to getting support.

Here, we’ll outline the key steps in customer onboarding, as well as some tips on how you can make it more effective.

Let's start from the beginning!

[**4 tips on User Onboarding that any Product Manager should read!**](https://blog.truora.com/en/user-onboarding)

**  
What is customer onboarding process in banking?**
------------------------------------------------------

The customer onboarding process begins with registration – whether that’s online or in-person. This is where you ask for basic information, such as name and address, and confirm that the person is actually interested in using your bank.

Once you have this information, you can begin the account application process. This includes filling out a form, providing identification and uploading a copy of your ID or driver’s license.

Once you’ve completed the application process, you'll be contacted to schedule a moment to open the account.

In some cases, you may also be asked to provide additional documentation or answer some questions about your finances.

After opening an account, the user needs to set up their login credentials and make initial transactions. This can be done through online banking, phone banking, or in-person at one of your branches.

> The customer onboarding process varies from bank to bank, but all of them involve building a relationship with new customers and helping them get started with the bank’s services as quickly and easily as possible.

**How are banks attracting new customers?**
-------------------------------------------

Traditionally, banks have attracted new customers through different strategies such as: advertising in traditional media such as radio or television, referrals from current customers, growth and organic traffic to their websites, among others.  
However, without neglecting these traditional methods, especially face-to-face customer service, either in the office or by telephone, there are currently new digital strategies on the market that allow you to attract the attention of prospects to finally convert them into customers.

Among these strategies we find:

*   Some banks focus on marketing their products directly to potential customers through social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. 
*   Others use targeted advertising campaigns on websites like Google AdWords or Yahoo! Answers. 
*   Many banks offer special deals or discounts to new customers – whether that’s for first time accounts or regular transactions made through digital channels like mobile apps or online banking systems.

> Whatever strategy you choose, make sure it's tailored specifically to target your audience and promote the benefits of using your bank.

Customer onboarding in banking: digital versus in-person
--------------------------------------------------------

While both digital and in-person customer onboarding have their benefits, digital methods tend to be more effective when it comes to getting people signed up for accounts quickly and making initial transactions without any fuss . 

This is because they allow people to complete the onboarding process from anywhere at any time – no matter where they are located . 

Additionally, digital customer onboarding processes can be automated, meaning they run smoothly without much input from your team.

On the other hand , in-person customer onboarding processes are often more personalized. This means that staffers will spend more time getting to know the individual customer and understanding their needs . 

As a result, in-person customer onboarding processes are often slower than digital ones, but they're often more satisfying for users because they feel like they're being taken care of personally by the bank.

Therefore, if you want to digitize your onboarding, never leave personalization aside. Make your users feel cared for by real people who solve their problems more effectively.

**How to do digital onboarding in banking (Guide)**
---------------------------------------------------

Digital customer onboarding is the perfect way to welcome new customers into your bank. With a few simple steps, you can create a personalized experience that helps them understand your products and services quickly and easily.

1.  Start by creating a welcoming sign-in screen that invites customers into your bank. Make sure to include your company's branding, logos, and other important information.
2.  Help customers understand your policies and terms of service by providing clear explanations on how they work – this will help them make informed decisions about joining your bank.
3.  Display relevant product information on screens throughout the customer experience – this will help them get the most out of their interactions with your bank!
4.  Make it easy for customers to make transactions – provide helpful guides and clear instructions on how to use your products and services.
5.  Thank customers for their time and encourage them to return soon!

**Tips to improve onboarding in banking:**
------------------------------------------

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to improving your customer onboarding process, as the best approach will vary depending on the specific needs of your bank. However, some general tips that may help include:

### **Creating a welcoming environment for new customers**

Make sure that your onboarding process is easy to follow, and that all the information your customers need is readily available. This will help prevent any potential headaches or confusion, and make them feel welcome from the start.

### **Making sure new customers understand their obligations**

It's important to make sure new customers are aware of their responsibilities under the terms of their account, and what they need to do in order to keep it running smoothly. This will help reduce complaints and ensure everyone is playing by the rules.

### **Streamlining the customer onboarding process**

By making it as quick and painless as possible for new customers to get up and running with your bank, you can minimize the chances of them leaving in a hurry. This will save you valuable time and resources in the long run.

### Developing an automated system

If possible, try to develop an automated customer onboarding system that can handle all of the necessary paperwork for newcomers without any fuss. This will both speed up the process and save you time overall.

**Types of digital channels for onboarding**
--------------------------------------------

There are a number of different digital channels that banks use to welcome new customers and onboard them into the bank culture.

  <title>4 consejos sobre User Onboarding para Product Manager</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/user-onboarding</url>
  <content>5 min read

• March 31, 2022

*   [Intro](#top)

At Truora we have seen how other companies have to sacrifice growth and user experience for security, to provide some solutions to this dilemma from my experience as Chief Product Officer at Truora, a few weeks ago I was an exhibitor for America Digital Mexico.

At the event I shared with representatives of the Fintech, Retail, and Marketplaces industries, 4 super important points about how companies face day-to-day their onboarding and user acquisition processes, and what is the best strategy to grow the company, from the stories we have lived in Truora. 

I summarize it here: 

A bad User Onboarding strategy causes a huge negative impact on the customer relationship from the very beginning.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be clear about the impact of a bad onboarding strategy, we can start with the fact that all companies spend large sums of money on marketing campaigns to attract customers.

On average, the cost of acquiring a single user ranges from $5USD to $13USD, in the best-case scenario, since the cost will depend on the effectiveness of the campaigns.

However, when they do, 63% of customers abandon the onboarding process, especially in financial services. 

Do the math and ask yourself, how much does your company invest annually to increase customers? Surely quite a lot of budget, as in proptech, retail and fintech industries the sums are usually very large.

Now compare that value with the return on investment you get.
-------------------------------------------------------------

*   Is the result astonishingly positive?
*   If the answer is yes, all of us here want to get your advice.
*   If the answer is no, I can assure you that you owe a lot of that to your current user onboarding process.

63% of customers abandon the User Onbaording process, especially in financial services, out of frustration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research shows that there are more than 80 apps installed on an average smartphone.

Even, a common user can have more than one screen in use while performing a process. In other words, our potential user can easily be watching Netflix, while trying to register on our platform to make a purchase or request a service. 

Well, that is the user we are facing today, one that seeks to do everything quickly, efficiently and instantly.

Their time is money and they are looking for immediate, simple and personalized answers from the companies they choose. And that, is where most companies fail.

When we talk about fintech, proptech and retailers, onboarding becomes the first big step a user takes within the company and therefore, their experience should be:

F: Easy

A: Automatic

S: Simple

T: Transparent

If you currently believe that onboarding in your company is not a "FAST" process, don't worry, in a large percentage of cases it is the opposite: Complicated, manual, slow and confusing for users.

It is necessary to revolutionize User Onboarding to grow as a platform or application and increase user acquisition rates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scenario is clear, evolving is no longer enough, it is necessary to revolutionize, so I will share some key points that every onboarding process must take into account:

*   Avoid long processes: ask in the "onboarding" only for what is indispensable.
*   Do not use long forms, if you need to capture a lot of data, try to do it after the registration and in a subtle way.
*   Provide clear instructions that show response time.
*   Assume that your user will make mistakes and will not read, including visual resources and short messages.
*   If you need to perform validations, reach your user in the channel that is easiest for them. Always with the option to redirect if necessary. 
*   Consider: is it important for me to check everything in real-time, or are there things I can validate later? 
*   WhatsApp is the key answer to simplifying Onboarding and delivering a high-level user experience.

This is the best part, for example; if being a Fintech you needed to have teams of call centers, online advisors, or great coverage in branches so that your users could open a bank account, with Truora and WhatsApp all that goes to the background, because each of your users can write to a WhatsApp line and in a 100% automated way, open a bank account, apply for a loan or purchase a particular product without leaving their home.

In addition, you will not have to worry about identity verification because, using simple conversation flows you can validate their information, credit history, and legal and criminal records on more than 2000 bases globally, request all documents through WhatsApp, perform facial recognition with a photo or proof of life with a simple video and even collect their signature electronically from their cell phone and in minutes. Impressive right?

  <title>10 effective tips to increase your conversion rate</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/increase-conversion-rate</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

One of the most important aspects of any business is their conversion rate. **This is the percentage of visitors who end up completing a desired action**, such as signing up for a subscription, downloading a whitepaper, or making a purchase.

**The higher your conversion rate, the more revenue you will generate**. We can start with some quick tips that you cannot miss in your conversion strategies:

But don't go yet, we want to explain in more depth the importance of the sales conversion rate, its relationship in onboarding and some tips for the banking sector and actions you can implement on your social networks.

**[Learn how to reach new customers with WhatsApp Marketing](https://blog.truora.com/en/whatsapp-marketing)**

**What does conversion rate mean?**
-----------------------------------

As we mentioned before, the conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who take a desired action after visiting your website or landing page. This could be signing up for a mailing list, filling out a contact form, or downloading your product or service. 

There are many factors that can affect conversion rate: the design of your website, the type of content you offer, the layout of your pages or the way you promote your content and products. 

However, one of the most important things you can do to improve your conversion rate is to create interesting and useful content that appeals and connects with your target audience.

**How can your onboarding process improve your conversion rate?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

One of the most important steps in converting visitors into customers is getting them through your onboarding process. 

This is the process of welcoming new members to your organization, from exploring your site to completing a registration form or signing up for a newsletter. 

**A well-designed onboarding process can help you convert more visitors into customers** by automating certain steps and providing helpful tips and instructions.

*   For example, you can create a series of videos that guide users through the entire conversion process from start to finish. 
*   Alternatively, you can provide step-by-step guidelines to help navigate users through the most important tasks on your site.

In either case, **make sure that your onboarding process is easy to follow** and provides valuable information about what’s available on your site. 

If users have trouble completing a task or finding information, they’re likely to abandon your site altogether.

**How do you increase sales conversion rate?**
----------------------------------------------

Sales conversion rates vary widely from company to company, but there are several common techniques that you can implement to improve yours.

**First:** make sure that your website design is user friendly. Poorly designed websites are often hard to navigate and frustrating to use, which could lead users to abandon your site immediately.

**Second:** provide helpful content that explains how products or services can benefit users in specific ways.

**Third:** create clear contact forms and easy sign-up procedures for subscribing to your mailing list or registering for events or webinars.

 **Finally,** ensure that all of your advertising campaigns are targeting potential customers who are likely candidates for buying your products or services (for example, people who have recently made a purchase at another business within the same industry).

There are a few things you can do to increase your conversion rate on financial products and services:

1.  **Educate customers about your product or service**. Make sure you're clear about what the product or service does, how it works, and why it's important.
2.  **Offer a free trial or demonstration**. This will give customers a chance to try the product before they decide to buy it.
3.  **Promote seasonal sales and special deals**. This will draw in more customers who are looking for good deals on products they're interested in.
4.  **Showcase your customer testimonials and reviews**. These will help convince potential customers that investing in your product or service is a good idea.
5.  **Use visual content to attract attention** . This includes images, infographics, and video content . 
6.  **Use social media platforms** to connect with customers on an ongoing basis . This will create loyalty and encourage them to return to your site for future purchases.
7.  **Increase the relevance of your social media content** . Make sure that all of the content you publish is relevant to your target audience, and that it's updated regularly and appropriately.
8.  **Target ads** specifically at people who are likely to be interested in what you have to offer . This means using targeting mechanisms such as cookies and interest-based grouping (IBS) . 
9.  **Measure your success with social media** **campaigns** in terms of leads and sales conversions, not just Likes or shares . 
10.  **Keep an eye on trends in the industry**, both positive and negative, so you can adjust your marketing strategies as needed.

**What does conversion rate mean for social media campaigns?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Nowadays many companies use social media marketing as an effective way of reaching new customers and developing relationships with existing ones.

However, achieving high conversion rates on social media campaigns can be difficult, particularly if you're not familiar with the various methods available . 

There are two main types of conversions on social media: leads and sales: 

Leads are people who have shown interest in something such as: signing up for a newsletter or viewing a sample product but haven't yet taken any action.

Sales conversions occur when someone completes a purchase after becoming interested in something via social media marketing . 

To increase both leads and sales conversions on social media platforms, it's important to understand how people interact with these platforms:

*   What kinds of conversations spark reactions?
*   What topics tend to result in more engagement?

Once you know these things, it's easier than ever to target specific audiences with content that will appeal to them.

**Tips to increase the conversion rate in social media**
--------------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned before, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to increase conversion rates using social media, however, here are 10 key actions you can implement now in your company:

1.  Use social media to promote your company's products and services.This will help boost traffic to your website and increase the chances that **potential customers will convert into customers!**

9.  **Avoid spamming followers** with irrelevant content .
10.  Always **be prepared to answer questions**, if someone asks about a product or service, know the answer!

**Why use WhatsApp to increase the conversion rate?**
-----------------------------------------------------

Let's start by saying that WhatsApp is the most used social network by Latin Americans to communicate on a daily basis.

> According to a survey conducted by the Latinobarómetro Corporation in 18 countries in Latin America: 64% of the population of the continent uses WhatsApp.

  <title>Guide about Customer Acquisition (step by step)</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/customer-acquisition</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

If you are here, probably you want to i**ncrease the number of customers** that daily buy your product or services. Another option is that you may be here to i**dentify possible strategies** or mechanisms that will help you **reduce your marketing costs without losing your growth potential**.

Luckily, we are here to help you understand more about how to **increase your brand awareness and revenue in a cost-effective way.**

In a few words, customer acquisition refers to **gaining new consumers**. Sadly (but always true), your **clients won’t stay around forever** — no matter how good your retention strategy is — so you need a way to **keep your business moving forward**.

Customer acquisition covers each aspect of a **new client journey**, from lead generation to finally **materializing its interest in a proper conversion (sell).** This process is not always running smoothly as most of you may desire, some customers enter your website but **never make a single purchase.**

Because **customers are the lifeblood** of any business, there’s always a need for different strategies to **continually bring new customers that indeed make purchases**.

**What is a customer acquisition strategy?**
--------------------------------------------

Customer acquisition strategies are a set of **activities or mechanisms** a company may take to **gain new users or clients**. Also known as customer acquisition management, the main goal of these strategies is to be able to **repeat the actions that attract customers** to your business naturally.

But wait, this is not the same goal as marketing?

[**Guide to improve customer onboarding in banking**](https://blog.truora.com/en/customer-onboarding-banking)

**What is the purpose of customer acquisition strategies**
----------------------------------------------------------

Now that you know the difference between customer acquisition and marketing, other important reasons why these customer acquisition strategies are important, is because when you have them in place, they **increase your brand awareness, sales, and recommendations**. 

Furthermore, when you **acquire the right customer for your business -** in a cost-effective way- they are likely to r**emain buying your product/service** and they also will **likely recommend** your business, further **increasing the total number of customers**.  

When the total number of clients arises, probably you will spread, driving your sales and ultimately your business. Finally, when your sales increase, more new products or services you can offer or new regions **you can expand** to.

**Cost of customer Acquisition**
--------------------------------

To have an indicator that **measures the efficiency to acquire new clients**, different metrics are being used by marketers. Between these metrics, the Customer Acquisition Cost, **also known as CAC**, is widely used because it measures **how much effort (time and money) a company has to put in to gain a new customer.** 

This metric is relevant because the last thing that a business wants to do is acquire new customers **with more money that the new user is going to spend buying their products**. 

The CAC can be calculated as the total costs associated with acquisition (marketing and sales employees, advertising, operational cost) divided by the total number of new customers acquired within a specific time frame.

> CAC= (Total marketing + sales cost) / Total number of new customers

**How to increase your customer acquisition rate**
--------------------------------------------------

There are different strategies that could be placed depending on your **needs** and your **self-assessment**. Not all methods work the same for all companies, a good customer acquisition strategy **uses data to understand consumer behavior** and identify optimal marketing opportunities to close deals **with your ideal client**.

Here we present you the most relevant ones:

### **Paid advertising**

This is a business-as-usual approach. For traditional companies, Ads produce results immediately, generating traffic, leads, and sales right after you launch. However, this tactic can get very expensive very fast if you don’t optimize your conversion funnel with the right practices.

### **Content Marketing in Social media**

While traditional marketing is used in sectors such as food and car sales, **disruptive businesses** or companies that use new technologies have better results using **social networks as their main channel of communication with new clients.** 

However, the best strategy, according to the new marketing trends, is not that you have to use other types of content and not only Ads. 

**Content marketing** is a practice in which you **share relevant information with your customer** regarding the advantages of using your product or service to solve a customer’s need or pain. Furthermore, it is important to say that this strategy usually involves a **mix of cross-channel** marketing campaigns. 

**Content marketing is based on engagement and not big advertising budgets.**

If you want to increase the conversion rate of leads into customers in the conversion funnel, do not forget that **the more people that enter the funnel, the more they will end up buying** the product in the end.

### **Search Engine Optimization**

SEO is also one of the main marketing trends in recent years. In a few words, SEO is a series of optimization practices for your websites and profiles so they are easily found by your potential customers when they use a search engine to respond to their needs.

### **Email marketing**

We check our mail **at least one time every day**, for this reason, an email that invites the purchase through **specific value information for each type of client** you have can help increase your sales.

However, all of the above strategies have something in common, they are all about **taking the customer’s needs first**. This change has to be made to **better understand your customer at all stages of the engagement and buying process**. 

Understanding also, **how** (and why) **individuals interact** with each channel differently.

When you adopt a customer-first approach, **building personalized relationships** with them, it’s easier and probably that they will convince themselves to buy your product or service.

Furthermore, this customer journey has to be supported by other strategies such as approach diversification, ideal client identification, and user acquisition channel definition to maximize your customer lifetime value.

[**How Truora is helping Trii grow Colombia’s investment industry**](https://blog.truora.com/en/fintech-industry-growth) 

As stated before, for businesses being able to connect with more customers, a digital migration of their customer acquisition strategies is required.

A digital acquisition marketing strategy is based on social media, SEO and Ads to target and attract specific customers at low CAC. 

To do so, different messages have to be displayed in the different social networks to take advantage of each one of the main benefits of each social network. 

For example, if you want to attract young people, a customer acquisition manager has to design his strategy based on Instagram and TikTok. Meanwhile, for an adult market, facebook may be the best social network to deploy Ads. 

However, It is important to note that WhatsApp is ideal for banking and financial business due the high opening rate, which, according to Forbes magazine, is up to 98%, being a excellent choice to minimize your CAC.

  <title>Truora is helping Trii grow Colombia’s investment industry</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/fintech-industry-growth</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Trii is Colombia’s Robinhood, and will soon be expanding into Peru and Chile, hoping to eventually become the region’s leading retail investment app. 

In the short time they’ve been in the market, they’ve integrated to the local stock exchanges, allowing their users to buy and sell both local and international stocks, from local businesses to US companies.

Trii´s mission of providing easy access to investment opportunities, will help the population gain more financial education so they can do more with their savings and plan better for their future. 

**But what is Trii's strategy to increase the number of users on its App and accomplish their mission?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a world where all financial services are competing for our attention: which APP do you choose to download, and why? Because let’s face it: we never download them all.

Facing the issue of increasing user acquisition, Trii began creative marketing campaigns, but their growth team soon realized that while expanding the user base through marketing was definitely impactful, they were not doing anything to re-engage already interested users who never completed their flow. 

> “On a normal platform 60% of users drop off during onboarding. Why? User’s drop off a flow for multiple reasons, but the main one is usually: distractions. We live in a world of multiple distractors, and forgetting to complete a task is normal.” 

  
With this in mind, Trii and Truora worked closely on testing out campaigns to re-engage users. And they did this, not through their APP but through WhatsApp. **(Why WhatsApp?** [**read this other post**](https://blog.truora.com/en/proptech-user-convertion-rate)**)** 

By automating different outbound messages via WhatsApp, they were able to recapture the attention of previously lost users. 

The campaigns proved to be great assets: Trii no longer lost all invested cost of bringing in the user to their onboarding flow when they dropped off, and users were happy to answer a WhatsApp message in order to get a premium financial service.

> Just in a few weeks, the re-engagement rate was 30% of previously lost users, with 90% successful digital onboarding flows (only 10% were non-apt users). 

Truora will now help Trii on offering more than just user-approval through WhatsApp. We will work on expanding offers and services in WhatsApp automated chatbots, so growth managers can run multiple campaigns simultaneously. 

By authenticating users identity, and automating user acquisition Truora is looking to boost the economy by helping businesses like Trii, to grow.

  <title>WhatsApp marketing for you inbound strategy</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/whatsapp-inbound-marketing-strategies</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Acquiring users for your platform through social media and email marketing tactics would seem to be the only channels available to reach your team's goals, but this is not the case, there is WhatsApp. 

While social media and email are the favorites, WhatsApp, with a daily activity rate of over 90%, and its 550 million users in the Latin American region alone, takes the trophy for the most effective channel for lead acquisition.  

This is especially true if you are in the B2B industry, which has the highest bounce rate of all industries: over 70% on the web, mobile, and tablet, surpassing the financial and Telco industries by 30%. 

How to measure a marketing tactic with WhatsApp?
------------------------------------------------

At the end of the day, measuring and showing the results of your marketing tactics is what validates all the effort that is published on the channels in the form of videos, copies, a survey, a reel, or anything else that creativity allows. 

With channels like WhatsApp, the task gets a little more complicated, as you need some API key to get your company's business account integrated with CRM, Tableau, Data Studio, or whatever your platforms are. 

Two things:

> TruConnect, Truora's solution, works for this and with no coding required, it's just "drag and drop" for all the campaign flows you want. 

> _With TruConnect there is the extra factor that we don't monitor as much as we would like in marketing teams: tools to ensure the security of campaigns._ 

**What does security have to do with Inbound Marketing campaigns?** 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine that your platform is going to launch a discount coupon campaign marketing to incentivize purchases to the list of users who abandoned the cart at the last purchase stage for whatever reason.

How do you guarantee that the same person is not using multiple phone numbers or newly created emails to access your discount? 

Is email the best way to get that coupon to them?
-------------------------------------------------

You will certainly need to integrate phone and email validation tools at some stage of the process and think about sending the coupon by a more instantaneous means before the user completely forgets that he or she was ever about to buy something from you. 

TruConnect is the integration of an identity validation tool with chat platforms such as WhatsApp. You just need to access the platform, set up your campaign with the validations you need, send it to your contact list and you will be able to monitor everything from your dashboard.</content>

  <title>Validate your users in minutes: Truora launch Truconnect</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/validate-your-users-in-minutes-with-truconnect</url>
  <content>Truconnect allows fintech, proptechs, banks and marketplaces to incorporate new users to their platforms, or recover those who abandoned the registration process via WhatsApp. Truora's already known identity verification and background validation is now in the most used chat app in Latin America.  

With Truora's Truconnect, anyone interested in opening an account or profile, will be able to do in a few minutes from their own WhatsApp the identity validation and background check process, without having to download an extra app or having to complete tedious paperwork or bureaucracy.

> _Our clients say that the causes why their potential users abandon the registration process halfway through lie in the existence of difficult-to-use channels, requests for printed documentation, and having to agree to wait several business days until they are finally accepted. With WhatsApp Onboarding all of the above problems are defended._

Commented Daniel Bilbao, CEO at Truora.

What can be done from Truconnect?
---------------------------------

Through a conversation via WhatsApp, anyone who wants to open an account with their favorite fintech, become a domiciliary, or open a profile in their trusted marketplace as a customer or seller, will have the opportunity to complete the registration process, identity validation, and background check, in minutes and without so many obstacles.

For Bilbao, in addition to Truconnect improving the user experience, the solution aims to decrease the Cost of Customer Acquisition (CoC) by 20% for fintech and marketplaces in Latin America, which in most cases would equate to more than USD 120,000 savings per month.

  <title>AI Atificial Intelligence: how is Truora embracing it?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/artificial-intelligence-how-can-latin-america-draw-inspiration-from-china-how-is-truora-embracing-ai</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

China is changing the global landscape, everyone knows that. But what can Latin America learn from them? The answer to this question is what I would like to talk about in this article.

In December 2019 I had the opportunity to attend a conference where Dr. Kai Fu Lee, former Google China President and AI expert, launched his new book on artificial intelligence. He talked about AI and how this technology is changing the way the Chinese live.

The country infamously known for producing low quality copies of American products, is now in many ways, setting the stage for artificial intelligence. In 2017, China announced that they would become a world leader in AI by 2030. To do so, the chinese government invested heavily in education. They also created tax incentives, more flexible regulations and even guaranteed a place to attend high school for the children of AI pioneers. A simple formula where education, plus investment, plus opportunity equals growth.

‍Today, China is one of the most evolved countries in different industries, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. Payments in this country, for instance, rely less on credit cards or cash. Alipay, which is responsible for 70% of all mobile payments in China, can perform B2C and C2C transactions. Some say that Alipay is better than cash.

‍This is one of the many cases where the Chinese have paved the way. They can also get a doctor’s appointment without any human interaction at the nearest Ping Me a Doctor stand available on the street. Their algorithm includes over 200 doctors and can map symptoms, make diagnoses, and prescribe medication in 60 seconds. You can even obtain a written prescription.

‍Although the news about technological advancements in China may appear like fiction, things were never always that way. In fact, as mentioned earlier, the chinese were known for their low-cost imitations of US and European products. But now, because the government has created the right incentives, their tech landscape has certainly evolved. The same can happen in Latin America.

‍This past year, there was an influx of investment on Latinamerican startups. Nearly USD 2.6 billion were invested on the first semester of 2019 alone. Brazil was the third country with the most number of unicorns in the same year, behind China and the US. It is a great time for new businesses. Companies like  Nubank, Rappi, Quinto Andar and Truora are proof.</content>

  <content>**By connecting WhatsApp to its onboarding API, Homie increased conversion rates by 30%.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As in any industry, fast-growing startups often emerge when they solve a market inefficiency, and in the case of proptechs, they are here to help simplify the process of real estate interactions in Latam. This is because from Mexico to Chile, there are many bureaucracy issues, security concerns, and overall terrible experiences.

It is for this reason that Truora teamed up with Homie to further optimize the experience users receive in a pilot project that focused on the peculiarity of users: homeowners and renters with different expectations but needing quick and easy information about their properties at the same time.

From Truora, the teams interviewed end-users, understood their day-to-day conditions (with technology and lifestyle in general), and proposed a new approach: using WhatsApp as a way to not only provide customer service but to incorporate users.

  <title>Digital transformation for businesses: What is it and how to adopt it</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/digital-transformation-for-businesses</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

**_Digital transformation is a fundamental change in how we operate, interact, and conduct business. Its relevance goes beyond mere technological change; it's a new way of thinking. In this post, I discuss exactly that!_**

Digital transformation is the integration of digital technologies across all aspects of a company to fundamentally change how it operates and delivers value to its customers.

It involves a total reinvention that spans from organizational culture to the way we communicate with our customers.

It's about placing technology at the core of your strategy. From process automation to the personalization of the customer experience, digital transformation becomes the guiding thread that connects every part of the organization.

The significance of digital transformation is evident on various fronts:

*   The ability of companies to **adapt to changing customer expectations**.
*   **Operational efficiency, through process automation**, data collection and analysis, and workflow optimization.
*   Unlocking new **business opportunities**. From expanding into new markets to creating innovative business models, digitalization opens doors that were previously inaccessible.

In summary, digital transformation is a necessity to thrive in the future of business. In this post, you will see:

*   What is digital transformation?
*   The impact of digital transformation on business performance
*   Beyond Technology
*   The relevance of digital transformation for businesses
*   Implementing digital transformation: a strategic approach
*   Practical tips for addressing these pillars
*   Transform your company and your way of doing business

What is digital transformation?
-------------------------------

Digital transformation is the strategic reconfiguration of a company that integrates advanced technology to optimize its performance, drive innovation, and adapt to a dynamic business environment.

This goes far beyond mere technological adoption; it involves an evolution in culture, processes, and business mindset.

From implementing tools such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, and automation, to reinventing business models, digital transformation redefines the way:

*   Companies interact with their clients. 
*   Manage their operations.
*   Generate value.

Its primary goal is to improve efficiency, agility, and relevance through a holistic and radical change that transforms the very structure of organizations, allowing them to innovate continuously and stay ahead in their industry.

The impact of digital transformation on business performance
------------------------------------------------------------

According to the study conducted by MIT and Capgemini Invent during the research cycle 2017-2020 focused on the topic _'Business Innovation in a Digital Era,'_ companies continue to expand their investment in digital transformation:

*   **62%** of companies claim to have invested 'more' or 'much more' in digital innovation compared to five years ago.
*   This inclination towards digital is more pronounced when evaluating the most successful business projects;
*   **95%** of surveyed executives responded that their most successful projects were essentially digital.
*   In recent years, a new wave of digital technologies - **AI, IoT, virtual and augmented reality (AR/VR), 5G,** and others - has also been observed, giving rise to countless business opportunities for continued innovation.

The report recommends following the following three steps within the framework of innovation to develop the required capabilities:

*   Identify technological competencies.
*   Create an architecture of innovation.
*   _Develop transfer processes._ [_(Source: Capgemini)_](https://www.capgemini.com/es-es/noticias/notas-de-prensa/informe-de-capgemini-invent-y-el-mit-el-futuro-de-la-innovacion-digital-pasa-por-modelos-hibridos/)

Beyond Technology
-----------------

Digital Transformation is not just about incorporating innovative technologies, but also entails a significant cultural and organizational change. This change is reflected in the business mindset and the way internal operations are conducted.

### **Cultural and organizational change**

The digital revolution goes hand in hand with a redefinition of the business mindset. The challenge is to establish a culture that embraces innovation, agility, and adaptability.

Challenging traditional hierarchical structures and fostering collaboration and continuous learning are the foundations of this transformation.

### Transformation in the way of working

The adoption of technologies is not just a superficial change, but it profoundly transforms the way daily tasks are carried out.

It's not just about implementing new tools, but how these tools transform internal processes, promoting collaboration, transparency, and flexibility in the workplace.

### Business mindset focused on innovation

Digital transformation empowers employees to adapt and make the most of new digital possibilities. The goal is to cultivate a mindset:

*   Customer-centric.
*   Data-driven.
*   Focused on constant innovation.

The relevance of digital transformation for businesses
------------------------------------------------------

Digital Transformation has emerged as a critical factor for business success.

This realization is based on two themes that we will develop further:

1.  The statistics and market trends.
2.  The essential difference between digital transformation and traditional business process reengineering.

### **1\. The statistics and market trends**

According to recent data, more than 90% of companies are engaged in some form of digital transformation initiative or have plans to start one soon.

#### **What is the reason for this?** 

Simply put, it's because the consumer audience is in the digital world. That's why the urgency and relevance of this change in the global business landscape.

*   [It is expected that the number of digital buyers in 2023 will exceed 337 million consumers in Latin America.](https://es.statista.com/estadisticas/1292075/usuarios-de-e-commerce-en-america-latina/)
*   [Global investment in digital transformation will reach $3.4 trillion by 2026.](https://www.ciospain.es/tendencias/la-inversion-mundial-en-transformacion-digital-sumara-34-billones-de-dolares-en-2026)
*   [Investments in digital transformation will reach $68 billion by 2030.](https://www.itreseller.es/en-cifras/2020/12/las-inversiones-en-transformacion-digital-alcanzaran-los-68-billones-en-2023) 

### **2\. Digital transformation vs. traditional business process reengineering**

It is crucial to understand the fundamental difference between digital transformation and traditional business process reengineering.

*   Business process reengineering solely aims to improve operational efficiency.
*   In contrast, digital transformation seeks to go further:  
    *   Generating new business models.
    *   Improving the customer experience.
    *   Allowing greater adaptability to market changes.

That's why I emphasize that one is an operational change and digital transformation is a mindset.

Implementing digital transformation: a strategic approach
---------------------------------------------------------

The successful implementation of digital transformation requires a structured approach based on key pillars established by industry leaders, focusing on fundamental aspects such as:

1.  Empowering employees.
2.  Customer loyalty.
3.  Operational optimization.
4.  Product/business transformation

I will discuss them in more detail below.

### Empowering employees

Human capital is the core of every company, and empowering employees to embrace change is essential in any digital transformation process.

This involves providing them with the right technological tools and, at the same time, fostering an organizational culture that promotes innovation, continuous learning, and collaboration.

An excellent example is Google, which fosters a culture of experimentation and continuous learning, allowing its employees to dedicate 20% of their time to innovative projects, leading to the development of key products like Gmail and Google Maps.

### Customer loyalty

The key to success in digital transformation lies in understanding and meeting the changing needs of customers. This involves using data to personalize experiences, offer tailored solutions, and provide exceptional service.

Amazon is a prominent example of using data to personalize recommendations and enhance the customer experience, which has significantly contributed to its dominance in e-commerce.

### Operational optimization

Operational efficiency is crucial in digital transformation. Adopting technologies such as process automation, artificial intelligence, and data analysis enables optimization of operations, cost reduction, and improved agility.

A notable case is Netflix, which uses artificial intelligence algorithms to recommend content and optimize the distribution of its platform, enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing its operations.

### Product/business transformation

Innovation is essential to stay ahead. Digital transformation is not just about adapting to existing technology, but reinventing products and business models.

Apple is a paradigmatic example of transforming the mobile phone industry with the launch of the iPhone, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.

Practical tips for addressing these pillars
-------------------------------------------

*   **Organizational Culture:** promoting a mindset of adaptability, continuous learning, and experimentation.
*   **Data and Analytics:** using data to understand customers, make informed decisions, and predict trends.
*   **Advanced Technology:** adopting technologies that drive innovation and improve operational efficiency.
*   **Experimentation and Flexibility:** fostering experimentation and being willing to adjust strategies based on feedback and market trends.

These pillars, when strategically addressed and combined with the willingness to adapt, are crucial for success in digital transformation. The integration of these strategies has been key in the rise of leading companies in their respective sectors, allowing them not only to adapt but to lead in an ever-evolving business world.

Transform your company and your way of doing business
-----------------------------------------------------

As you can see, digital transformation for businesses began to emerge in the past decade, accelerated during the pandemic, and solidified in the post-pandemic era as the option that best rationalizes resources.

We cannot deny that it is an economic issue; digital facilities reformulate all logistical challenges by reducing costs and increasing returns.

  <title>A project to develop agriculture in Colombia</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/agritech-in-colombia</url>
  <content>Agrapp was born with the vision of revolutionizing the development of the agricultural sector in Colombia. It has focused on making a productive impact, leveraging technology, through the promotion of credit allowances for small and medium-sized farmers.

Its vision is focused on connecting investors with profitable and productive agricultural projects that have helped to structure, execute and manage to achieve better marketing, promoting sustainable practices and the use of more technified processes for crops.

**What is Agrapp's strategy to increase the number of farmers with potential and fulfill its mission?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agrapp started with a very specific approach of visiting each of the agricultural projects that were recommended to them, and through paperwork and manual processes, they would evaluate the project and then publish it on their platform to connect it with investors. 

> They considered starting to implement technology in their processes but realized that many of the farmers were not familiar with platforms or applications. However, they identified that they did have a cell phone and also knew how to use WhatsApp.

With this discovery, together with Truora they worked on a pilot campaign for the registration and validation of farmers seeking financing options through WhatsApp.

The result was that through the automation of conversation flows they managed to register a significant number of potential users, and also minimize risks by including real-time validations such as document and face.

The implementation of this solution not only allowed them to be more efficient in time and money, as well as to optimize processes by not having to visit all projects personally. 

With Truora, they were able to exploit a channel that most of their target audience has access to and knows how to use.

Today Agrapp and Truora continue to work hand in hand with agricultural projects both in three verticals: 

*   Qualification of the application to find the best investor, financing projects such as purchases of invoices through factoring
*   Implementation of flows for the registration of potential investors who want to support farmers by providing opportunities to grow and improve their quality of life, all this through WhatsApp.

By automating processes, Truora seeks to be an ally to boost the economy and the welfare of farmers, allowing access to credit, investment and financing from anywhere without connectivity restrictions or face-to-face procedures, helping companies like Agrapp with high-impact initiatives to grow.</content>

  <title>WhatsApp Marketing Campaigns: Discover the 2024 Trends</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/whatsapp-marketing-campaigns</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

One of the most notable trends in the last decade is, without a doubt, the use of WhatsApp as a powerful tool in companies' marketing mix.

With a constant growth in its user base and popularity in countries like Mexico, WhatsApp has become an essential platform for efficiently persuading and converting customers in a personalized and engaging manner. 

In summary, WhatsApp marketing is a competitive advantage, and in this post, I'll share the main trends to help you run a successful campaign. Today, I'll cover:

*   The Importance of WhatsApp in Marketing
*   The Top 6 Uses of WhatsApp in Marketing
*   How to enhance Chatbots with AI Tools
*   Boosting Marketing with AI through Truora

The Importance of WhatsApp in Marketing
---------------------------------------

WhatsApp is a market leader with nearly universal adoption among customers. What does this mean? Simply put, it's highly likely that your customers are using WhatsApp.

*   According to Statista, in January 2023, **2 billion users accessed WhatsApp monthly, which is 1.3 billion more than its main competitor, Telegram.**
*   According to UNAM, 96% of Mexicans with internet access use WhatsApp for 6 to 8 hours a day.

These statistics demonstrate that WhatsApp is the most widely used messaging app globally and particularly in Latin America, making it an efficient marketing tool that fulfills two fundamental criteria:

1.  it's extremely **efficient;**
2.  it has massive **reach.**

For these reasons, it's crucial to pay close attention to WhatsApp marketing campaign trends.

The Top 6 Uses of WhatsApp in Marketing
---------------------------------------

Now let's explore the primary uses so you can assess which resonates most with you or which is most needed for your fintech or e-commerce business.

### 1\. Conversational Customer Support

Customers desire a fluid, enjoyable, and efficient dialogue. When a customer contacts your business, they have a need that your company resolves.

They expect a conversation and often have urgent needs. WhatsApp offers a direct channel for companies to interact with customers instantly.

Technology enables the automation of responses to common queries and provides 24/7 availability of intelligent chatbots, enhancing the customer experience and satisfaction.

### 2\. Lead Qualification and Conversion

Generating and qualifying leads is a key marketing task, and WhatsApp is an incredible platform for this function:

1.  **Qualification:** Use WhatsApp to collect valuable information to send relevant content that nurtures leads.
2.  **Conversion:** Personalized messages have significant power to trigger purchasing decisions.

### 3\. Integration with Other Tools

WhatsApp's ability to integrate with other marketing tools like CRMs and automation platforms allows for more efficient campaign management.

This ensures precise tracking of customer interactions and effective data management.

### 4\. Increased Automation

I have already mentioned automation before, but now I would like to emphasize in it. 

WhatsApp automation, particularly through chatbots, is continually evolving. Chatbots can perform a variety of tasks beyond human-like conversation, including:

*   selling;
*   order processing;
*   invoicing;
*   product suggestions;
*   sending reminders for key dates;
*   and more.

Believe me when I tell you that you have not seen anything yet. This wonderful technological world of automation is only beginning. Save time, resources and offer instant answers to your clients!

### 5\. Omnichannel Communication

Providing the option for dialogue across all channels has become a crucial focus for marketing because customers naturally navigate through them, almost imperceptibly.

WhatsApp is increasingly integrated into these strategies, allowing your company to connect all customer touchpoints coherently, organically, and effectively.

### 6\. Faster Sales Process

And finally, I want to talk about a slightly more technical aspect, which is **the importance of shortening cycles. This has two key aspects::**

*   duration incurs a cost;
*   delays payment.

Everything in operation demands resources, and if the process takes too long, the moment of payment is delayed. The logical conclusion is straightforward: **time passing where money is going out but not coming in.** 

WhatsApp accelerates the sales process by enabling direct conversations between sellers and customers, streamlining the evaluation and decision-making process for purchases.[](https://www.truora.com/es/automatizar-envio-de-mensajes-whatsapp-con-hubspot-crm)

How to Enhance Chatbots with AI Tools
-------------------------------------

Have you ever thought about how your customers' emotions are composed of data? 

By leveraging tools like ChatGPT and DALL·E, you can empower your WhatsApp chatbots in surprising ways, offering not only efficient and entertaining responses but also an emotional connection. 

That's what it's all about—knowing that they can rely on you! Let's dive deeper into how these AI tools can enhance your marketing strategies on WhatsApp..

### 1\. Launching a Campaign in Minutes via WhatsApp

The speed of implementing a marketing campaign is essential in a world where consumer attention is fleeting. Truora offers solutions to launch WhatsApp chatbots in a matter of minutes. 

This is achieved through an intuitive interface that simplifies the setup of automated response chatbots to reap significant benefits:

*   **time savings:** No need to invest weeks in programming and developing a chatbot from scratch;
*   **more flexibility:** Companies can quickly adapt their chatbots to meet changing customer demands;
*   **immediate response:** Chatbots can operate 24/7, meaning customers can get answers even outside of working hours.

### 2\. Using ChatGPT to Define Chatbot Texts

The quality of text generated by a chatbot is crucial for maintaining an engaging conversation with customers. 

ChatGPT is an advanced natural language processing model that converses coherently and naturally, significantly enhancing the user experience.

Its benefits include:

*   **Consistent responses:** ChatGPT can generate consistent and contextually relevant responses to a wide variety of questions;
*   **Natural interactions:** Customers will feel like they are interacting with a human due to the quality of the generated text;
*   **Increased customer satisfaction:** An improved user experience leads to more satisfied and loyal customers.

### 3\. Using DALL·E to Create Advertising Images

mages play a fundamental role in marketing, and DALL·E, a powerful image generation AI, can be used to create personalized and eye-catching advertising images for your WhatsApp campaigns. 

This adds an attractive visual component to your messages and captures users' attention in a unique and memorable way.

Its benefits include:

*   **Unlimited creativity:** DALL·E can generate images based on descriptions, giving you unlimited creativity in creating visual content;
*   **Personalization:** Generated images can be tailored to your audience and the specific message of each campaign;
*   **Increased engagement:** Customized images capture users' attention and can increase click-through rates and conversions.

By combining these AI tools with a versatile platform like Truora, you can fully leverage WhatsApp's potential as a next-generation marketing tool.

  <title>Millions of users have used Rappi safely thanks to Truora</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/rappi-users</url>
  <content>With Rappi we built a product from scratch and scaled it to the point where we turned it into a background check tool capable of supporting all the demand for Rappitenderos (RT) integration requests in Latin America.

How [Truchecks](https://www.truora.com/truchecks) became a solution that contribute to the accelerated growth of a company like Rappi? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing: listening to the client.

In this case, we understood that Rappi's mission is to give access to every user in an increasingly effective way.

And the focus was on continuing to increase the number of Rappitenderos (RTs) supported by the app, while ensuring that each user complies with the security and quality standards that characterize the company. 

Mary Ordosgoitia, Product Manager at Truora, is the best person to talk to about this. She was there from the moment Rappi contacted Truora, and knows closely the integration process of our [Truchecks](https://www.truora.com/truchecks) solution, via API.

Mary told us for this post about the early stages of building the product, and what were the biggest challenges the team faced in 2018. 

> "We did everything based on feedback. In the year that Rappi contacted Truora, our product Truchecks was in the MVP phase.

**And what was the result?**
----------------------------

In the first year, we helped them increase the percentage of Rappitenderos (RTs) who were securely On Boarded by 90%.

> Three years later, more than 2 million Rappitenderos (RT) accessed the services of their app from Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, and Chile, securely and quickly. 

And of course, initially, like an MVP, they were finding points for improvement, rules to adding, bases to integrate, etc. But together with Rappi's feedback, a robust and complete solution was created that today has thousands of sources of information for personal and driver background checks. 

But it didn't end there.

**Our solution has evolved to adapt to Rappi's needs and growth.**
------------------------------------------------------------------

Rafael Prado, Product Manager at Rappi, after all these years, ended up becoming our greatest ally and was the one who told us for this post that thanks to the use of Truora services, Rappi was able to identify risks in the Onboarding of Rappitenderos (RT) and prevent them with our technology, in different countries in Latin America. 

All these thanks to the close support of the Truora team, which helped to move quickly on important issues that generate more security for their processes.

### Today we celebrate three years of this partnership. These are our greatest achievements:

Millions of orders have been able to be delivered thanks to the 2 million Rappitenderos (RT) we have helped validate to register them in the app. 

> **you've probably received one of these orders! 🍕🍔** 

We went from a few thousand validations per month to hundreds of thousands.

> **This is how we increase capacity and decrease the waiting time between a user's registration approval, and their first order.  ⌛**

Just as legislations have changed over the past few years, at Truora we have also scaled the solution. We added new sources of information for background checks such as the PTP or Permiso Temporal de Permanencia: an administrative authorization issued by Migración Colombia. 

**What's next for Rappi and Truora?**
-------------------------------------

Truora's Director of Business Development, Silvio Rodríguez, shared his perspective on the opportunities of this alliance and what it means for the company's growth in the region in the coming years. 

"Our solution adds value to Rappi by combining two fundamental pieces for the company's growth: security and response times for users. We are now on the way to diversifying the use cases of the solution, replicating the background check for Rappitenderos Onboarding, in other areas and countries." 

**Do you want to know how we could also increase the conversion rate of new users on your platform?** 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are always looking to provide the best user experience most securely. 

That is why all our solutions for identity verification, background, phone, email, and facial recognition, among others, are integrated into platforms that allow those who finally interact with the tools to live an intuitive, fast and secure experience via WhatsApp, Web or API. 

The case of Rappi is one of the many that you can find in our Blog, related to the use of our solutions via API.

  <title>What is the Gig Economy work in Latin America?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/gig-economy-work</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Starting almost immediately from any of the gig economy apps that exist, having a flexible schedule, accepting one-time jobs and at any time, is the reason why this type of work has gained popularity, and became the largest source of income for the population in countries like Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Brazil.

The Gig Economy definition, is a non-exclusive business model, where people (Gig economy workers) perform a task at the request of another (client) through a channel, (App or a website), which offers the necessary services to carry out a commercial transaction and manage a service or product.

Although the term Gig Economy was created more than a decade ago in the United States, it is today, after the labor crisis caused by the pandemic, especially in regions such as Latin America, that the concept is gaining strength among those seeking to generate income.

If you see technology as an opportunity to achieve success as an entrepreneur, then you should start to familiarize yourself with the Gig Economy.

**Why offer Gig Economy jobs in Latin America?**
------------------------------------------------

### **Best Gig economy jobs in Latin America are a growing model**

Rappi, Uber, Airbnb, GetNinjas and BlaBlaCar are some of the examples that we can name as success stories within the gig economy.

Only in the first quarter of 2020, when the rules of social isolation came into force and we stayed in our homes, did “at home” services and products become essential and this had a positive impact on the financial results of the gig platforms.

For instance; In Chile, according to the newspaper La Tercera, until June 2020 the largest transportation services marketplaces in the country had reported increases of up to 140% in the number of registered active drivers, compared to the same period in 2019.

### **You need few resources to get started with Gig economy Apps in Latin America  
**

The Silicon Valley unicorns pioneering the Gig Economy did not start as we know them today.

In fact, the other day I was reading on the LinkedIn account of a Rappi employee the story of how they started their operations from a home in northern Colombia, recruiting a few gigsters, and with a group of friends who are passionate about technology and business.

To start, you will only need one person on your team who knows how to program, someone who is passionate about the commercial area, and another focused on marketing.

### **It is easy to expand your Gig Economy company to other latin countries**

In 2009 Uber was born in San Francisco, California, and only 4 years later, in 2013, it had reached a couple of countries in Latin America.

The rapid expansion of the company throughout the region was mainly due to innovation. They went on to generate greater accessibility to popular services, online payments, more security, agility in the provision of the service and practicality in the onboarding of drivers.

### Plataformas gig economy: tecnología a tu favor

Creating a gig platform from scratch is not an easy task when your resources are limited, that is why there are already tools that can facilitate this work. Some of these are:

> Power Apps: help in creating Apps to your liking.
> 
> Monday: manage your projects in different areas from the same platform to grow your business.
> 
> Twilio: strengthens and facilitates communication between your platform and its clients to offer the best service on a daily basis.
> 
> Gig economy companies: these are the most profitable in Latin America
> 
> Truchecks and TruFaces: 2 services from Truora, to verify the background check of latin american gig economy workers and monitorize in real time the fraudulent faces (the ones accused of mainly identity theft) in the region, so your Gig Economy platform can block the fraudster before affecting you. 

I will explain with the example of Brazil. Approximately 75% of the Brazilian population uses some transport application\* (like the Gig economy Uber), and according to a report published in 2020 by the personal financial management application GuiaBolso, on average each of these people spends about $ 300 USD per year using these services.

This means that of the 209 million people who live in Brazil, some 196 million are spent a year, approximately 59 million dollars transporting themselves through gig applications such as Uber, Cabify or 99.

We invite you to consult the values ​​in Mexico, Chile or Colombia, and remember that there are not only transport applications, there are also delivery, specialized services, real estate rentals and many more.

_\* IDC and PayPal Brazil survey, December 2019._

### **How do you get the best gig economy workers in Latin America to serve your platform?**

You always want to have the most suitable people representing your brand, in addition to guaranteeing your users the security and professionalism they seek in your application.

That said, it is essential that you look for technological tools to automate and optimize your work when choosing the best Gig economy workers in Latin America. Our recommendation?

[**WhatsApp**](https://blog.truora.com/es/whatsapp) demonstrated its great efficiency when used in its [**Business**](https://blog.truora.com/es/cuando-usar-whatsapp-business-o-whatsapp-api) mode for marketing and sales. Companies worldwide leverage it to establish stronger and more meaningful connections with their customers.

*   **Cost-effectiveness**: fits into the budget of companies of all sizes.

To these benefits you can add all the integration possibilities and the creativity of your teams to make the most of this fascinating tool. That's what I'll talk about today, WhatsApp Marketing, and successful examples of its use. 

In this post, you'll see:

*   Why companies choose WhatsApp for marketing
*   7 reasons to use WhatsApp Marketing.
*   Successful examples of WhatsApp Marketing usage.Ejemplos de Éxito en el Uso de WhatsApp Marketing

    *   Whatscook - useful and timely
    *   Toyota - #tbt Valentine's Day
    *   Banco Bolivariano - efficiency in banking
*   WhatsApp at the service of your marketing

Why Companies Choose WhatsApp for Marketing? 
---------------------------------------------

The answer to this question is relatively simple: when there's a disruption in procedures and a novelty is installed, it's because of the results.

WhatsApp, more than any other tool, managed to capture the contemporaneity of a market that demands direct and meaningful connections.

Customers want attention in its broadest sense, not just to be attended to in a general way, but to have attention paid to their particular problem. Traditional media have become insufficient because they can be invasive, inadequate, or untimely.

### **A special connection with your brand:**

Direct and personalized communication between companies and their customers translates into greater closeness to the brand, as customers perceive a more personalized treatment and faster attention to their needs and inquiries.

*   **No intermediaries: c**hatbots with artificial intelligence solve problems simulating human attention.
*   **Adaptability and flexibility: c**ustomers are also 24/7 and have their preferences and particular circumstances.
*   **Transparency and trust:** everyone trusts WhatsApp thanks to its cryptographic system.
*   **Proactivity and anticipation:** by collecting data, you can better orient and prevent.
*   **Empathy:** demonstrating understanding of customers' concerns and challenges is what strengthens the emotional connection with your brand.

### The Era of Hyper-Personalization

Thanks to data capture and processing, you can be more precise when sending messages and increase relevance and timeliness, which are two key aspects for the success of marketing campaigns.

*   **Advanced segmentation:** segment your audience into groups based on demographic and behavioral data.
*   **Tailored messages:** adapt message content to the interests and needs of each customer.
*   **Relevant offers:** send offers that are of interest to each individual user, increasing the likelihood that they will interact with the message and respond positively.
*   **Customer-centered communication:** focus on the individual preferences of each customer.
*   **Increased interaction:** stimulate interaction from customers with messages that make them feel identified.

### Cost-Effectiveness to Improve Customer Experience

We must consider that it is very easy to speak, but we cannot forget that constantly improving the customer experience can be costly.

That is another fundamental reason when opting for WhatsApp Marketing: it allows you to implement effective strategies to improve the customer experience without demanding an excessive budget.

Additionally, if you need help implementing your WhatsApp Marketing strategies, there are already specialized agencies that can provide you with personalized services and expert guidance, so you can make the most of this powerful communication tool.

7 Reasons to Use WhatsApp Marketing
-----------------------------------

As I mentioned earlier, WhatsApp marketing is imposed by its results. Therefore, I'll list the 7 main reasons why you should consider a WhatsApp marketing strategy.

### **1\. Increase sales**

Let's start with the main thing, it's all about increasing sales, that's why we invest efforts and resources.

*   Responding quickly to customer inquiries, solving problems and offering real-time assistance closes more sales and captures more leads.

### **2\. Expands your customer base:**

A special connection with your target audience increases opportunities to acquire new customers.

*   By tailoring your messages to the individual interests and preferences of each segment, you will attract a broader and more diverse audience, thus expanding your customer base.

### **3\. Retains more customers**

We all know that acquiring a customer is much more expensive than retaining them, which is why loyalty strategies are so important.

*   Quick and personalized communication creates a positive experience for your customers, increasing their loyalty.

### **4\. Reduces Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

But acquiring customers is also important and, as we already said, this has a cost.

*   ### By reaching your leads directly and personally, you reduce costs associated with campaigns and strategies to lead them through the sales funnel.
    

### **5\. Increases Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**

**Acquisition + retention = increased CLV.**

*   Facilitate repurchase using captured data and providing a positive and satisfactory service.

### **6\. Improves cost-effectiveness:**

WhatsApp Marketing is a highly cost-effective option compared to other traditional marketing channels.

*   Maximize the return on your marketing investment and reduce overhead costs.

### **7\. Increases operational efficiency**

And your team? How much do you spend to keep it operational?

*   Streamline internal processes and improve operational efficiency by reducing workload and optimizing time and resources.

Successful Examples in WhatsApp Marketing Usage
-----------------------------------------------

And finally, here are some success stories of companies that successfully integrated WhatsApp into their marketing strategies, leveraging its advantages to improve communication with their customers and increase brand engagement and loyalty.

### **Accor - Simple and Awesome**

Innovative, simple and very cheap ideas, such as providing a direct WhatsApp number along with your room key for guest service. It's the power of imagination and technology working together.

This chain of hotels from Accor in the UK and Ireland understood it very well.

### **WhatsApp Toks - Without Intermediaries**

["Toks direct to your home"](https://www.facebook.com/ToksMx/posts/con-un-par-de-mensajes-por-whatsapp-puedes-pedir-tus-platillos-favoritos-de-toks/4421382894578106/?locale=ms_MY) is an innovative initiative by the renowned Mexican brand Toks, which leverages the WhatsApp platform to offer home delivery services, quickly and easily.

But it went beyond that in its customization and understanding of customer pain; it launched a campaign where, by sending a photo of the inside of your refrigerator, it gave you advice on what to cook.

This is about understanding utility and how to solve a customer's problem, directly through WhatsApp.

### **Toyota - #tbt Valentine's Day**

A decade ago, [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/espanol/) didn't just send service reminders and special offers to its customers. It created a campaign for Valentine's Day offering an AYGO 70 3p x-play in x-white to the most romantic WhatsApp message.

The result was a record engagement and interaction, as well as virality on social media and news outlets.

### **Banco Bolivariano - Efficiency in Banking**

El [Banco Bolivariano](https://www.bolivariano.com/), a leading financial institution in Ecuador and a pioneer in online banking in the country, stands out for offering comprehensive financial services to corporate and personal clients via WhatsApp using artificial intelligence.

  <title>Background check API solutions to fight Latinamerican fraud</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/background-check-api</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Truora’s simplified approach to a complex challenge: Background Check API solutions.[](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/21471312/662a704d-1d77-4c6d-99f5-1a513600bcfa)

Fraud in Latin America is a behemoth of a challenge for the region. It costs billions of dollars every year and affects the security of millions of people. Truora, a Y-Combinator startup, has taken up the challenge and their main weapon is a set of APIs.

One of those is a background check API used by many companies to hire safely and keep their users safe in a variety of ways. It requires a person’s national Id, which is used to verify their identity, and operates by searching several databases to obtain a person’s both criminal and legal records as well as matching their name with international databases of wanted criminals and media broadcasts regarding criminal activity, additionally, it searches for the person’s healthcare, pension and similar affiliations.

But it doesn’t only work for people, but also vehicles and companies and it operates in several countries across Latin America.

So, what makes this API so good? Let’s take a closer look:

**Easy to Integrate**
---------------------

JSON-encoded responses with intuitively-named attributes and comprehensive documentation makes integration with Truora’s API a breeze.

**Simplified background check Scores**
--------------------------------------

One way to summarize the plethora of information returned by the background checks are scores, these grade the person, vehicle or company reliability in several categories like identity, criminal, legal, alert in media, among others.

Scores in the API and its documentation are both easy to understand and use, and allow for effortless processing of the large amounts of information related with background checks.

**Customized background check Scores**
--------------------------------------

In addition to the scores generated by default, Truora’s background check API allows the creation of customized scores allowing users to decide the impact of certain findings on a background check result, for example: a user can decide to increase the impact of theft, for instance, on a person’s overall score. Or, a user can decide to overlook a person’s legal background for their overall score. This flexibility allows scores to reflect the user company’s policies and principles regarding background check evaluation.

**Webhooks  
**
---------------

Truora’s background check API uses webhooks to notify users and keep them informed of changes in background check statuses, this is especially useful for checks made in batch, since the process can take a long time (about 2 hours per 100 checks) and for continuous checks, a background check option that periodically performs background checks and notifies users whenever the score changes.

  <title>International background check in AL, how is it obtained?</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/international-background-check</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

The international background check is a set of queries on a person to verify their identity, confirm that they are who they say they are and thus avoid any type of fraud and yes, it is possible to do Background Check in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Brazil from the United States. 

What does an international background check show?
-------------------------------------------------

International criminal background check constitute an opportunity to know the judicial background of individuals, information about previous jobs and the veracity of the education degrees that the person presumes to have achieved.

Any additional information that is relevant to a company, such as a person's vehicle history (if you want to hire a driver, for example), is also part of this process. In general terms, any information that may jeopardize the reputation or security of the person making the inquiry is consulted and analyzed in an international Background Check, with the consent of the person being examined. 

**How do I do a background check on someone in another country?  
**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

At Truora, international background check company, we provide this service online and the results are obtained in minutes. We facilitate and speed up the consultation of multiple databases for international background check in several Latin American countries, including Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Mexico.

But that's not all. Our platform global background screening allows massive queries of up to 500 people or companies at a time in more than sixty national and international background check databases.

Some of the public databases to get accurate background Check in Latin America are:

*   Procuraduría General de la Nación (Colombia).
*   National Registry of Civil Status (Colombia)
*   National Population Registry - RENAPO (Mexico)
*   Public Vehicle Registry - REPUVE (Mexico)
*   Receita Federal (Brazil)
*   Civil Registry and Identification Service (Chile)

International databases that include criminal background check:

*   OFAC - Clinton List (USA)
*   Interpol (Global)
*   FBI (USA)
*   Third party consultation
*   Hiring a search team

**How much does an international background check cost?  
**
------------------------------------------------------------

That will depend on different factors such as the country from which you want to get the international background check, on which variables and whether the background check will be done via API or not.

  <content>**_It could be a lead that converts into a client, a decision-maker of a strategic corporate entity or a legal entity; whatever the situation, background check with a KYC process is the common point to stay one step ahead._**

The main function of KYC is to provide you with security to make the best decisions and mitigate as much as possible the chances of errors, crises, and conflicts. In other words, [the KYC process in Colombia](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc) is no longer just a matter of security; it is also a center of value creation for your company.

Background checks are essential for:

*   Assessing and mitigationg risks
*   Preventing fraud

Today, I will talk about why background checks play a vital role in making labor and financial decisions in the country and how these inquiries have become strategic tools to protect the interests and integrity of individuals and organizations.

Importance in Labor and Financial Decisions
-------------------------------------------

Selecting the best candidates for key positions in your company or strategic business partners can be a challenging task. It is also challenging to evaluate the solvency and reliability of your leads and convert them into clients who do not fall into arrears.

For this reason, background checks are essential to obtain objective information in all cases and make data-driven decisions that directly impact the economic growth of Colombia in general and your company in particular.

### Mitigating Risks and Frauds

By investigating the work, financial and legal history, you can identify inconsistencies or potential risks and take proactive measures to avoid financial losses or damage to your company's reputation.

Likewise, in the financial field, it helps to detect irregularities, unusual activities and fraudulent behavior, allowing your company to protect itself against risks and safeguard the interests of its customers and shareholders.

What is a Background Check?
---------------------------

A background check is the review and collection of relevant information about an individual or entity, including their history of:

*   Employment
*   Education
*   Financial
*   Legal

This practice is carried out to assess the suitability and reliability of a person or company before making critical decisions such as hiring staff, granting loans or entering into a business partnership.

The most representative process of this information check that protects your company is [KYC; (Know Your Customer)](https://blog.truora.com/es/kyc-y-pld) which provides you with a comprehensive view of the person or entity in question.

The Relevance of Background Checks 
-----------------------------------

The essence of the relevance of background checks is that they help you make the best decisions among a large volume of possibilities. That is why they are so important in the Colombian labor and financial environment.

    *   **_+_** **_customers with a high average ticket._** 
    *   **_+_** **_quality in decision-making._**  

Methods of Inquiry
------------------

In the background check process, there are two main methods:

*   **Manual:** which involves direct searching in relevant databases and records.
*   **Third-party conducted:** in which specialized services are hired to conduct the inquiry.

In this section, we will explore both methods and provide examples of databases and records in Latin America.

### Manual Inquiry Method

This method involves the applicant personally conducting the search in relevant databases and records. It requires a lot of time and effort since it involves navigating through various sources of information to collect the necessary background.

**This includes reviewing human resources files, court records or requesting criminal background reports from the competent authorities.**

The problem with this method is that it is labor-intensive and highly sensitive, requiring professionals with the experience or appropriate resources to avoid mistakes.

### Third-Party Inquiry Method

The third-party inquiry method involves hiring specialized services to conduct the background check on behalf of the applicant.

These services usually have access to specialized databases and advanced search tools, allowing them to obtain information quickly and accurately.

Additionally, by having trained personnel in data interpretation and identifying potential risks, these services can provide you with detailed reports and customized analysis according to the needs of your company.

### Need for Consent

It is important to note that, in most cases, the consent of the individual or entity subject to the inquiry is required to access their personal information.

This consent can be explicit, through the signing of a form or agreement, or implicit, in the case that the inquiry is made in the context of an established labor or financial relationship.

It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure that all applicable regulations and laws regarding privacy and data protection are complied with.

Databases in Latin America
--------------------------

In Latin America there are several relevant databases and records that you can consult to obtain labor, financial, legal and educational backgrounds. Some of them are:

4 Simple Steps to Background Checks
-----------------------------------

Now we will tell you the steps, something relatively simple based on common sense.

*   **Step 1 - Identify the information source**
*   **Step 2 - Access the corresponding website:** make sure you are accessing the official website of the entity to ensure the truthfulness and reliability of the information obtained.
*   **Step 3 - Conduct the background check:** depending on the type of background being consulted, additional data may be required such as the judicial case number or the type of tax debt.
*   **Step 4 - Review and download the documents -** these may include certificates of disciplinary records, tax statements, judicial records and corrective measures, as appropriate.

As you can see it's very straightforward, but, at the same time, it can be quite labor-intensive. Additionally, if someone with little experience were to handle this process manually, it could be a headache in the future.

That's why my advice is to use the services of a specialized company that can:

*   **Handle large quantities of background checks.**

*   **Provide greater accuracy.**
*   **Do so in much less time.**
*   **At a very low cost.**

  <title>Background Check API solutions to fight Latinamerican Fraud</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/growing-api-solutions-to-fight-latinamerican-fraud</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Truora’s simplified approach to a complex challenge: Background Check API solutions.

Fraud in Latin America is a behemoth of a challenge for the region. It costs billions of dollars every year and affects the security of millions of people. Truora, a Colombian startup, has taken up the challenge and their main weapon is a set of APIs.

One of those is a api for background check used by many companies to hire safely and keep their users safe in a variety of ways. It requires a person’s national Id, which is used to verify their identity, and operates by searching several databases to obtain a person’s both criminal and legal records as well as matching their name with international databases of wanted criminals and media broadcasts regarding criminal activity, additionally, it searches for the person’s healthcare, pension and similar affiliations.

But it doesn’t only work for people, but also vehicles and companies and it operates in several countries across Latin America.

So, what makes this API so good? Let’s take a closer look:

API background check easy to integrated
---------------------------------------

JSON-encoded responses with intuitively-named attributes and comprehensive documentation makes integration with Truora’s API a breeze.

‍**Simplified Scores  
**
-------------------------

One way to summarize the plethora of information returned by the background checks are scores, these grade the person, vehicle or company reliability in several categories like identity, criminal, legal, alert in media, among others.

Scores in the API and its documentation are both easy to understand and use, and allow for effortless processing of the large amounts of information related with background checks.

**Customized Scores  
**
------------------------

In addition to the scores generated by default, Truora’s API allows the creation of customized scores allowing users to decide the impact of certain findings on a background check result, for example: a user can decide to increase the impact of theft, for instance, on a person’s overall score. Or, a user can decide to overlook a person’s legal background for their overall score. This flexibility allows scores to reflect the user company’s policies and principles regarding background check evaluation.

**Webhooks  
**
---------------

Truora’s API uses webhooks to notify users and keep them informed of changes in background check statuses, this is especially useful for checks made in batch, since the process can take a long time (about 2 hours per 100 checks) and for continuous checks, a background check option that periodically performs background checks and notifies users whenever the score changes.</content>

  <title>5 Tips to optimize our background verification platform</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/5-tips-to-optimize-our-background-checks-platform</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Before we dive into our five tips to better use our platform, I’d like to explain why background checks are important. According to Unisys 2019 Security Index, 69% of people surveyed fear identity thefts more than war threats, terrorism and natural disasters. In the US alone, around 14.4 billion people were victim of this type of fraud, which cost an approximate of USD 3.4 billion in 2018\*.

The preferred method to steal a person’s identity was the creation of accounts under the name of the victims. Their names were used for mortgages, student and car loans and of course, credit cards. 

‍Identity theft is becoming easier due to technological advancements and an easier access to personal data through social media and via a method called “phishing”, where individuals are induced to give away personal information through emails purportedly sent from reputable companies. There are more creative ways to steal one’s information nowadays, which is why we should pay special attention to whom we give our personal data.

As a company, Truora has the ambitious mission of eradicating fraud in Latin America. To that end, we are using the best technology to support our clients’ businesses. Our platform facilitates and accelerates the way companies do background checks. We do identification verification as well as provide exhaustive information on a person’s criminal and vehicle history.

To help you take full advantage of our background check platform, we have listed a few tips below:

**Object of the Query**
-----------------------

Our platform can be used to verify the identity of new employees, clients, suppliers and partners in every country we operate. If the person or company has an ID or tax number, it’s possible to obtain background information on them.

**Timing**
----------

We recommend performing a background check at the beginning of your recruiting and onboarding processes. That way, you can avoid wasting precious time and you can also have visibility of potential threats to your business to make the right decisions before it’s too late.

[](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/21471312/4d35cd48-171c-48de-853c-f24072adfe41)**Alerts**

You can create media alerts to stay up to speed on any news regarding a new hire, supplier or partner, as things can change in one day. For example, if a supplier obtains the highest score on their background check today but is involved in some form of illegal activity tomorrow, you’ll receive an update on our tool. This could prevent reputational damage to your brand.

**Frequency**
-------------

Our final recommendation when using our background check product is to do so monthly or every two months to avoid surprises that could harm your business.

  <title>With Truchecks Listos automates the hiring processes</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/listos-automates-its-temporary-services-hiring-processes-thanks-to-truchecks</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Technology is changing the way all types of companies operate today, including the world of recruiting, staffing and hiring. And it is traditional companies who face the biggest challenge in aligning themselves with this reality that is changing the way they do business.

This is not new information and you've probably asked yourself: what kind of technology does my company need, how can I use technology to improve my processes, do I need a tech-savvy team to do it?

This is the story of how Listos, one of the country's largest and most traditional temporary companies, included new technologies in its operation. By optimizing and standardizing their processes, they stand out in the industry for being the most reliable and secure company in the provision of temporary services, generating value for their clients and partners.

Listos' operation begins when one of its clients has a vacancy. At that moment, the company activates all its recruitment sources to obtain as many candidates as possible. To fulfill its value promise (to be the safest company in the provision of temporary services) it is necessary to validate these candidates and review their backgrounds.

Once the candidates' backgrounds are validated, Listos selects only the best and most reliable profiles. These are then subjected to psycho-technical tests and finally affiliated to social security to meet all the conditions required by law.  
"We want to be the most reliable expert in the provision of temporary services, preferred for its standard of service and the creation of value for our clients and partners," said a company spokesperson.

Listos operates in 20 cities around Colombia and, like other agencies, is under pressure to execute its processes faster and increase revenue without sacrificing its promise of value and customer service.

Here's a step-by-step look at how we helped Listos strengthen its competitive advantage and streamline its recruitment and hiring processes.

**Cutting-edge technology to protect customers**
------------------------------------------------

By including Truora as a partner to perform background validations on its candidates, Listos was able to reduce risk on its platform, protecting and maintaining its good reputation. Thanks to a more detailed background validation with our platform, Listos helps its clients protect themselves against fraud while making their hiring processes faster and more efficient.

**Process Automation**
----------------------

Before its partnership with Truora, Listos had a team of employees manually validating its candidates' backgrounds. Today, with the use of our tool, Truora allows Listos to automate the process without using the same resource. This change has allowed the company to streamline its operation, provide faster service to its customers, and produce happier customers who are more willing to reuse the service and invite more people to get to know it. This, in turn, translates into higher revenues.

**Standardization of information**
----------------------------------

With Truora, Listos found a way to standardize the information obtained in its manual processes. By validating all candidates with the same tool, there is no room for human error. And so the value promise of being the most secure temp in the market is getting closer and closer.

**Score parameterization for the consulted candidates**
-------------------------------------------------------

Truora allowed Listos to parameterize the score or confidence level obtained on the platform when consulting a candidate according to the needs and priorities of the company. For example, if for a specific Listos client it is paramount that candidates have no criminal or criminal record, but legal processes are less relevant, they can adjust or "play" with the importance of each of these categories and offer a customized validation. Once again, happier and more satisfied clients.

**Applicant follow-up**
-----------------------

While we were able to automate the background validation process for Listos, our follow-up was intermittent, not permanent. We corrected this when Listos included our alerts functionality in their processes in case their candidates' profiles changed. In this way, we ensured visibility into employee score variations and helped Listos provide greater security to its clients at all times.

> Our culture is open and ready for transformation, incorporating best practices

Listos currently performs just over 70,000 validations annually with Truora and has optimized its operations significantly. However, one of the most important changes of this transformation was the API integration. Listos went from being a traditional company with manual processes to reviewing its candidates through web services.

  <title>This is how Casa Bravo optimizes its Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</title>
  <url>https://blog.truora.com/en/this-is-how-casa-bravo-optimizes-its-know-your-customer-kyc-processes</url>
  <content>*   [Intro](#top)

Analyzing the judicial, criminal, international, and financial background of prospects is a fundamental part of a financial institution that seeks to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) policies to prevent fraud.

This work is done through technologies that automate the analysis of public databases, providing the company with tools to determine with total objectivity whether or not a person represents a legal and reputational risk.  

An example of a use case is Casa Bravo - the first rent-to-own program in Mexico -, which adopted in its innovation strategy technologies such as Truchecks for the background study of prospects, obtaining effective results that allow them to follow the rent-to-own process with their prospects in a much more agile way.

This is because:

**They have greater confidence in decision-making**
---------------------------------------------------

TruChecks is a tool for automated background analysis that adapts to the decision variables of any company, guaranteeing complete and deep queries, thanks to exclusive features such as names\_matching and retries.

By integrating this technology into its operations, Casa Bravo is assured that the results of each person analyzed and on which the final qualification of prospects in terms of reputation and background are based are complete, becoming essential during the decision-making process.

**Your team reduced analysis time**
-----------------------------------

By gaining in assertiveness and speed, they get to analyze as many people as possible, in the shortest time and with greater certainty. It is a great relief in terms of costs and team time to go from a manual validation that takes 5 days to obtain results in just minutes.

**They have the necessary support for the analysis of the results**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Casa Bravo has been supported by Truora's CX and Product teams for the customization of the Truchecks tool. Making their job of verifying the identity of their prospects easier, and allowing them to focus on their primary activity.

\--

Background validation is a process that is still done manually in many companies, unaware that this opens the door to the possibility of making decisions based on bias or human error. "With Truora, we can avoid potential risks, criminal and legal issues that our clients might have," concluded a company spokesperson. 👇👇👇👇
